      <title>Why no comments?</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/no-comments/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 09:52:39 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/no-comments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Previous incarnations of this website provided a facility for comments in the usual way for a weblog in the first decade of the 2000s&amp;mdash;a comment form on each entry. This one doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Comment forms are ugly. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time &lt;em&gt;moderating comments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;wading through yet another medium that&amp;rsquo;s 90% spam is  not a good way for me to use my time or energy. Publically available comment forms on the web are mostly buckets for spam and other detritus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, there are &lt;em&gt;plenty of other ways&lt;/em&gt; you can comment on anything I do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;reply to me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Use your favourite twitter client and post a link to news item you&amp;rsquo;re discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include the reference to my twitter handle &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;@consequently&lt;/a&gt;,  or if you simply link to a page on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ll see your reply when I check twitter. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy for me to include tweets in posts, like this one &amp;hellip; &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-star logic workshop in Banff, 2007 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TT?src=hash&#34;&gt;#TT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&#34;&gt;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/yMX8yHufgn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yMX8yHufgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Richard Zach (@RrrichardZach) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RrrichardZach/status/558299627569836032&#34;&gt;January 22, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &amp;hellip; so if you&amp;rsquo;d like to comment, that&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a short message out, in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got something that&amp;rsquo;s longer than a tweet&amp;rsquo;s worth, write it, make it available on the web, and let me know. If I get useful feedback in public, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to link to it on the page, or point readers to it on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could always just &lt;a href=&#34;#about&#34;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>What’s the point of a personal website these days?</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/the-point/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 23:05:00 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/the-point/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My last post to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt; was in late in 2010, well over four years ago. You&amp;rsquo;d be &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; in thinking that I&amp;rsquo;d abandoned the site&amp;mdash;but you&amp;rsquo;d also be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the site behind the scenes. The software I&amp;rsquo;d been using to maintain the site has long since &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TwP/webby&#34;&gt;fallen into disrepair&lt;/a&gt;, so updating the site meant porting everything to another content management system. At least, it would have to mean that, given that I &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; really keen to burn the whole thing to the ground and start again from scratch. This required &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t require &lt;em&gt;four years&lt;/em&gt;, but it did require an uninterrupted stretch of time to tinker with software, experiment with the design, and finally, piece everything back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting back into all of this website business, however, I wanted to answer one question. Is the investment of time worth it? &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the point of a personal website these days, anyway&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, people can &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where you might find a brief remark or more each week. (Or you might find &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23advent%20OR%20%23adventure%20OR%20%23christmas%20from%3Aconsequently%20since%3A2014-11-30%20until%3A2014-12-27&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;virtual “advent calendar”&lt;/a&gt; when I&amp;rsquo;m a bit more adventurous.) I occasionally &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/consequently&#34;&gt;post photos on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see me there if you like that sort of thing. You can find (most of) &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfBBS7AAAAAJ&#34;&gt;my publications on Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, and you can even find &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;instructional videos I&amp;rsquo;ve made available to the public on Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. You can even join in with &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic1&#34;&gt;classes I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic2&#34;&gt;teach (with Jen Davoren) on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, and you can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org&#34;&gt;philevents.org&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org/search/index/searchForm?span=PAST&amp;amp;customTag=&amp;amp;speakers%5B0%5D.id=1176&amp;amp;autonamespeaker=Greg+Restall&amp;amp;series=&amp;amp;search=true&amp;amp;hits=&amp;amp;widget=&amp;amp;Search=Search&#34;&gt;keep track of talks I&amp;rsquo;ve given&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve  been inactive on the web, even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been leaving a much of a trace &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; lately. Isn&amp;rsquo;t all that web presence enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it isn&amp;rsquo;t. At least, it isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me in 2015. Let me explain why, by turning to the different sections of this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; section keeps track of all of my academic publications. Where I can, I archive pre- or post-publication versions of my papers, and sometimes I upload versions of papers here &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; submission, to get the ideas out as quickly as possible, and to get feedback. I could do that without having my own website. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://philpapers.org&#34;&gt;Philpapers.org&lt;/a&gt; is a great way for people to upload draft papers in philosophy, for example.) But at your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; site, you can present yourself however you see fit, and you can make it easy for people to find your work. You provide a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; for  aggregators to aggregate. That&amp;rsquo;s one reason to take control of your own body of work. As long as the HTTP protocol keeps going, I can host my own work and people can find it. &lt;em&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;philpapers&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;journal websites&lt;/em&gt; can come or go. As long as people can get here, they can keep track of my work. If someone asks how to keep up with what I write, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;ll point them. A &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; I control: &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sections of the website were more pressing for me, though, as I thought about why it was important to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;room of one&amp;rsquo;s own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the web. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making more of my &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; resources available to the public, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gregrestall&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. While I use our campus &lt;a href=&#34;https://lms.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;LMS&lt;/a&gt; to distribute materials to my on-campus students, that&amp;rsquo;s basically walled off to non-students. I can&amp;rsquo;t point non-Melbourne students to that if I want to give them access to teaching resources, or simply to catch up on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have somewhere to do that. So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/class&lt;/a&gt; will serve as a directory of all my recent and future teaching resources—at least, all of the resources I&amp;rsquo;ll be making freely available to everyone, and it can be a straightforward first port-of-call for anyone who wants to check out a class I teach, to see if it interests them. Teaching is a very important part of what I do, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to spread this material far and wide if it will help others. I think it will help me, too: the more opportunities for feedback on teaching materials I get, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation&#34;&gt;Presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The same holds for &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; I give. I&amp;rsquo;d like there to be a simple, stable URL for each talk, whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/towards-fixed-point-models-logicmelb/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/trmra-asubl5/&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/cemd-anu/&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/christian-academic-monash/&#34;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/tractatus-masterclass/&#34;&gt;kind of presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put materials from talks online, and sometimes I won&amp;rsquo;t. But in any case, I want to have an archive of recent and upcoming talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news&#34;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; section of the website, which can be the home for not-academic pieces of writing which don&amp;rsquo;t fit well into &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;140 character&lt;/a&gt; chunks, and which don&amp;rsquo;t find a place in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;more considered pieces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; These are pieces of writing like &lt;em&gt;this very discussion&lt;/em&gt;. While some find places like &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; a suitable home for longer-than-twitter online writing, I&amp;rsquo;m fond of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/catarinadutilhnovaes/&#34;&gt;people&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umsu.de/wo/&#34;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://kjhealy.org&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m itching to get back into it, with some occasional writing of my own, to supplement more considered academic pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of my return to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s end with the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;. The short answer is what you see in the footer of the website (as I write this). &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is the CMS that wires things together into the website. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, relatively straightforward to learn if you&amp;rsquo;re used to command-line tools, and can it cope with the not-completely-straightforward taxonomy of my site. Hugo seems to be under active development by its founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/spf13/&#34;&gt;Steve Francia&lt;/a&gt; together with an active &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; of users and developers. It looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hand-coded the HTML (designing it to be &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; friendly for small-screen devices) using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com/kube/&#34;&gt;Kube Web Framework&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com&#34;&gt;Imperavi&lt;/a&gt;. (Please let me know if you see any website design bugs.) The main body and header font is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Alegreya&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous font designed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/juandelperal&#34;&gt;Juan Pablo del Peral&lt;/a&gt; for the Argentinian Type Foundry &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huertatipografica.com&#34;&gt;Huerta Tipogr&amp;aacute;fica&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Apply liberal doses of &lt;a href=&#34;http://marketlane.com.au&#34;&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cockburnproject.net&#34;&gt;Bruce Cockburn&lt;/a&gt;, a few late nights&amp;rsquo; worth of coding, and you get the website you have before you. I hope you like it. Please get back to me, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;replying to @consequently&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, or by email, if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3.</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2010/11/16/Testing_testing_1,_2,_3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2010/11/16/Testing_testing_1,_2,_3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just testing to see if this thing is on.  Yes, it seems to be working.  How about that!? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty rusty, but apparently this site still works. That&amp;rsquo;s good to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few items of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been way too busy coordinating the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Philosophy program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne to be posting here. It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy ride for the year, but it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic. It looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be in the saddle again for 2011, so hopefully having learned how to hold the reins this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to post here a little more next year.  No promises though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing. Doing lots of writing.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few changes on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page. I&amp;rsquo;m most happy with the new paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;A Cut-Free Sequent System for Two-Dimensional Modal Logic: and why it matters&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a little philosophy there, and a little proof theory, too. It&amp;rsquo;s not too long (just 24 pages), and I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate your comments. Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt; to download the paper and post your comments.  (Make sure you admire the in-line diagrams on page 16. That&amp;rsquo;s LaTeX, with no postprocessing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next travels involve a trip to Guangzhou to take part in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.helsinki.fi/logic/sellc-2010/&#34;&gt;SELLC 2010&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s going to be a blast, helping teach a Winter School to a bunch of enthusiastic students, and with a great slate of lecturers. It&amp;rsquo;ll be good to catch up with Samson, Robin, Mehrnoosh and Dag, and to meet the rest of the lecturers, as well as my colleagues at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;ILC&lt;/a&gt; at Sun Yat-Sen University.  On the way home from Guangzhou, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick side trip to Boston for the Eastern APA, to contribute to a session on the future of logic, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~horty/&#34;&gt;John Horty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/&#34;&gt;Johan van Benthem&lt;/a&gt;.  What fun!  This will be my first ever APA, so if you have any advice for an APA neophyte, do let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Time Flies</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/10/20/Time_flies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/10/20/Time_flies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time flies like an arrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fruit flies like a banana.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;d realise I&amp;rsquo;m still alive.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that from the activity &amp;ndash; or lack thereof &amp;ndash; here.  (Though a few papers have appeared &amp;ndash; or changed their publication status &amp;ndash; on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where we are: It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy, eventful semester, and the teaching period is almost done.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had fun teaching proof theory to fourth-year students, tutoring intro philosophy to first years, and supervising graduate students (at last count, I have eight current research students in various stages of the degrees).  One of the sadder things to befall us here at Melbourne is the departure of Allen Hazen, who as left our shores for the chillier climes of Edmonton.  The Melbourne logic community&amp;rsquo;s loss is Canada&amp;rsquo;s gain here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;m off on a short trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=760&#34;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, by way of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~arche/events/event?id=212&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy/department/events/phs_seminars/phs_seminars.html&#34;&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s the long way around, but somebody has got to do it.  I&amp;rsquo;m busy clearing the decks here of as much as I can before the trip.  One of the decks to be cleared is this blog, so a post is in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posting about not posting for a long time is so &lt;em&gt;pass&amp;eacute;&lt;/em&gt;, so here&amp;rsquo;s a link to something you might like if you&amp;rsquo;re a logic person like me.  Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Wandering Mango&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s program &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Mac OS X only).  It&amp;rsquo;s a very neat natural deduction educational tool: it helps you produce valid Fitch-style natural deduction proofs, using the format of the major texts used in intro teaching.  Well, as far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re the major texts ued in intro teaching in North America.  In Australia, in Europe, in the UK, logic is taught in different ways: &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=SFa6AIB1Ct8C&#34;&gt;Smullyan-style tableaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=2sCuDMUruSUC&#34;&gt;Gentzen tree-style natural deduction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;Lemmon-style linear natural deduction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;though see the update below&lt;/em&gt;) with labels, etc.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot you need to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going to cover the ground of all the ways of teaching introductory logic by way of &amp;lsquo;proofs&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in touch with the developer, and he tells me this is only the beginning for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s built in a modular fashion, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to start extending it to cover more systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you teach logic, or if you&amp;rsquo;re learning logic and you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn it by having a proof assistant on side to keep your proofs on track &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;take a look at &lt;em&gt;Deductions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update on December 8, 2009&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sfu.ca/~jeffpell/&#34;&gt;Jeff Pelletier&lt;/a&gt; reminds me in an email that Lemmon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;beginning logic&lt;/a&gt; was not the first to introduce what I called &amp;lsquo;Lemmon-style&amp;rsquo; linear natural deduction. Patrick Suppes, in his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=jFRwDqpoN2UC&#34;&gt;Introduction to Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For more on ths history of natural deduction, a great place to start is Jeff&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/NDHistory.pdf&#34;&gt;A Brief History of Natural Deduction&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Thanks for that, Jeff!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Posting has been light, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been powering through work at the end of the semester, and getting ready for a quick trip west to Europe, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~ncm/&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Mathematics 2009&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=1297&#34;&gt;Logica 2009&lt;/a&gt;, preceded by a quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/philosophische_fakultaet/iph/termine/vortrag_restall&#34;&gt;visit to Dresden&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tu-dresden.de/phfiph/prof/lowiphil/hwa.htm&#34;&gt;Heinrich Wansing&lt;/a&gt;, and to break up the train trip from Frankfurt to Prague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, posting here has paused for a bit, but now that I&amp;rsquo;m settled in Hejnice and that there&amp;rsquo;s a wireless connection here, I can deal with some of my backlog of things I&amp;rsquo;ve promised to post.  So, here&amp;rsquo;s a salad of links for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Faculty, the Arts Faculty, at the University of Melbourne, is holding a short &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;Winter School&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;July 15 and 16&lt;/em&gt;, for students from Ausralia (but outside Victoria), to come and get a taste of the range of research done in the Faculty.  If you&amp;rsquo;re from inside Australia but outside Victoria, you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;high achieving honours student&amp;rsquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;d like a trip to Melbourne to see what we do, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;please apply&lt;/a&gt;.  Applications close June 22, so you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be quick!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m helping organise &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/iclc2009/&#34;&gt;ICLC2009&lt;/a&gt;, the Intenational Conference on Logic and Cognition at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, held from &lt;em&gt;November 2 to 4, 2009&lt;/em&gt;. The deadline for getting your paper in for this conference is a leisurely &lt;em&gt;October 1, 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  Guangzhou is great (&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2008/11/14/off_to_guangzhou/&#34;&gt;I was there last year&lt;/a&gt; and had a wonderful time at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/&#34;&gt;Institute for Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;), and if you can come along, please do &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=757&#34;&gt;submit a paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Griffin and Bernard Linsky are hosting &lt;a href=&#34;http://pm100.mcmaster.ca/&#34;&gt;PM@100&lt;/a&gt;, a conference on the 100th Anniversary of the publication of &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;. That conference is from &lt;em&gt;21&amp;ndash;24 May, 2010&lt;/em&gt; at McMaster University in Ontario, and paper submissions are due only on &lt;em&gt;January 1, 2010&lt;/em&gt;, so for this you have more time to get things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no deadline at all for joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;Friends of the SEP Society&lt;/a&gt;.  Are you a Friend of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;?  So many of us &amp;ndash; students, academics, interested readers &amp;ndash; use it for our research, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great resource for everyone.  If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular user of the SEP (and if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in philosophy, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be?), consider joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;the Society&lt;/a&gt; to help support the work of the Encyclopedia.  For a small fee, you support the encyclopedia, you help it keep up its mission of free, high quality introductions to philosophical themes &amp;ndash; and you get access to great quality PDF versions of the entries in the SEP, which are just ideal for printing out and reading (and annotating) offline.  You also (if you like) get email notifications whenever the articles you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded get updated.  It&amp;rsquo;s a good deal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much cheaper (at US$25 a year for a full subscription, down to US$5 a year for a student subscription) than a journal subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to posting on more substantial things later.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a conference to attend. For little quips along the way, you can follow the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rumfitt on Multiple Conclusions, Part 2</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/02/Rumfitt_Part_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/02/Rumfitt_Part_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;a series of comments&lt;/a&gt; on Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84).  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I focussed on Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s direct criticism of my approach in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; and I tried to show that his criticism missed the mark, and that it missed the mark in an important way. The norms of logical consequence and logical coherence apply not only to occurrent beliefs but to all manner of states of accepting and rejecting (or acts of assertion and denial), whether they express our deep standing beliefs or hypotheses we simply entertain lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, I want to consider the comments on the possibility of genuine &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; with multiple conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumfitt writes (and I&amp;rsquo;ll quote him at some length here), on page 79:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rarity, to the point of extinction, of naturally occurring multiple-conclusion arguments has always been the reason why mainstream logicians have dismissed multiple-conclusion logic as little more than a curiosity. (See e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Taming-True-Neil-Tennant/dp/0198237170/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Tennant 1997&lt;/a&gt;, 320.) And attempts by enthusiasts to alleviate the embarrassment here have often ended up compounding it. In the introduction to their textbook on the subject, Shoesmith and Smiley concede that multiple-conclusion proofs can scarcely be said to form part of the everyday repertoire of mathematics. &amp;lsquo;Perhaps the nearest one comes to them&amp;rsquo;, they go on, &amp;ldquo;is in proof by cases, where one argues &amp;ldquo;suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; &amp;hellip; suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; but &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &amp;hellip; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. A diagrammatic representation of this argument exhibits the downward branching which we shall see is typical of formalised multiple-conclusion proofs &amp;hellip; But the ordinary proof by cases is at best a degenerate form of multiple-conclusion argument, for the different conclusions are all the same (in our example they are all instances of the same formula &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley 1978&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5). &amp;ldquo;At best degenerate&amp;rdquo;, though, hardly says it. I do not know how the word &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; is used in Cambridge, but in the rest of the English-speaking world it is understood to mean &amp;ldquo;more than one&amp;rdquo;. So an example of an argument in which all the conclusions (&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;) are identical provides little justification for taking multiple-conclusion logic seriously. But since this is all that Shoesmith and Smiley provide by way of a positive case for deeming their system to be a branch of logic, readers of their book may be forgiven for closing it with a sigh on reaching p. 5 of the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, in defence of Shoesmith and Smiley, the one example of proof by cases (in which the intermediate formula are all the same) is not the only consideration they provide in favour of taking their system to be a branch of logic.  Showing that it is a codification of a notion of (let&amp;rsquo;s call it) &lt;em&gt;quasi&lt;/em&gt;-proof which delivers logical consequence on Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequents, and which, when restricted to single conclusion deductions agrees with traditional natural deduction should count for something.  If it&amp;rsquo;s not a branch of logic, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a single case where the only multiple conclusions aren&amp;rsquo;t very multiple is not very satisfying. But there is a genuine sense, of course, in which even in this case the conclusions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; multiple.  Surely they have heard of the type&amp;ndash;token distinction outside of Cambridge?  There is a perfectly admissible sense in which the rule of conjunction introduction (in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s natural deduction) requires &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; premises, even when the instance used is a derivation of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.  (To rewrite this to be a proof from one instance of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; may radically change the structure of the proof, especially if both instances of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; are proved in very different ways.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is a minor point, not worth any more of our time.  More important is the way that Rumfitt missed what is going on in proofs by cases.  I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that he missed my example of a proof featuring multiple conclusions, discussed in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on page 199 to address just the point Rumfitt raised here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose everyone is either happy or tired. Choose a person. It follows that this person is either happy or tired. There are two cases. Case (i) this person is happy. Case (ii) this person is tired, and as a result someone is tired. As a result, either this person is happy or someone (namely that person) is tired. But the person we chose was arbitrary, so either everyone is happy or someone is tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be perfectly valid reasoning: It&amp;rsquo;s a proof.  It&amp;rsquo;s a renderng in (somewhat) natural language of a sequent derivation of &amp;ldquo;everything is an &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or something is a &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  (For the sequent derivation I used, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this proof, there are two conclusions active at a number of points.  Stop the proof before the sentence starting &amp;ldquo;As a result&amp;rdquo;.  Consider the state of play at this point in the derivation.  We have a proof from &amp;ldquo;Everyone is either happy or tired&amp;rdquo; to the two conclusions: &amp;ldquo;Case (i) &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is happy.&amp;rdquo; (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is an eigenvariable standing for &amp;lsquo;that person&amp;rsquo;, which in turn points back to the choice made after the supposition.)  &amp;ldquo;Case (ii) someone is tired.&amp;rdquo;  In other words, we have a proof corresponding to the sequent (everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;Fa&lt;/em&gt;, something is &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot think of any way of understanding the deduction up to that point in such a way as to (a) see it as a single deduction, and (b) not introduce irrelevant connectives not explicitly used in the text.  This example seems to me to be strong evidence that one can find in nature real-life uses of multiple conclusions in action, if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know where to look, you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need tricky cases of intuitionistically invalid arguments to make the point.  The point is there in Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; examples of proof by cases.  If you stop a proof by cases (in the middle of the ellipses eliding the interesting bits of the subproofs, in the bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith &amp;amp; Smiley&lt;/a&gt; quoted by Rumfitt) you will get more interesting cases where the conclusions in play differ.  For example, take this proof of (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;). (Ignore the bracketed markers [a], [b] and [c] for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  Then it follows that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  It follows that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  So, we have two cases: (i) &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and (ii) &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [a] Consider case (i).  Here, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  Consider case (ii). Here, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [b].  Back in case (i), it follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  In (ii), it also follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) [c].  So, we conclude, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this seems to me to be perfectly understandable reasoning.  The point at which Rumfitt jokes about &amp;lsquo;multiple&amp;rsquo; instances of the conclusion &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; corresponds to our point [c], where we have proved the conclusion (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) in each case, but have not yet drawn them together to a single conclusion in the argument.  True, at this point we have a proof with two instances of the one concluding formula.  This is no better or worse than a proof with two instances of the one premise formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But [c] is only one place to stop the proof.  Suppose we pause at point [b].  What do we have there?  It&amp;rsquo;s a proof from one premise &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;), leading to two cases, one in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and the other in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  This corresponds to the sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and the two concluding formulas are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me confess: I engineered this case by interleaving the two cases in the text, to get to an intermediate step in both of them.  But this does not render the case any less salient.  I could have stopped at point [a], and here, what we have got to is a sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  In other words, we have just got to the point at which the disjunction is broken up into two cases, and each case is ready for further processing using the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the core idea of multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;natural deduction&lt;/em&gt;.  The disjunction rule can be understood simply, as taking us from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; to the two conclusions &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  which can then be operated on as usual, in the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; proof.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t like this, that&amp;rsquo;s fine.  However, that is not an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion structures can&amp;rsquo;t be found in natural reasoning.  They are there if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few days I&amp;rsquo;ll post a response to what I take to be the most interesting of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s arguments, his considerations against the Cut Rule.  But that, I suspect, will take a little more time, and other duties are pressing for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, comments on these ideas are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;Thanks to Ole Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been alerted to Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84.).  In it, he makes a number of critical comments on multiple conclusion accounts of logical consequence, and in particular, he makes some critical remarks on my paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  Now, the criticism of mutiple conclusion consequence isn&amp;rsquo;t the main point of the paper&amp;mdash;the main topic is how one can acquire knowlege by deduction, as the title indicates. On that topic, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting paper, and I hope to comment on those parts at some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since the paper ends with the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have found reason to leave multiple-conclusion logics to the boy racers, and focus on the single-conclusion rules, by following which we can splice together the deliverances of various sources of knowledge to come to know things that we could not know otherwise.  (page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the criticism of multiple conclusion consequence plays a significant role in the paper, and in how Rumfitt thinks of the topic of acquiring knowledge by deduction.  The &amp;lsquo;boy racer&amp;rsquo; image&amp;mdash;which I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is not intended to be flattering to people like me who have advocated multiple conclusion logics&amp;mdash;arises out of an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion logics are finely tuned machines, which are fiddly to maintain, like a sports car.  I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the metaphor for readers to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the criticism I should reply in some kind of public forum, to get a response out there.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem appropriate to write an extensive essay just in response to a few points made in one paper, though I may make the remarks in some other paper I&amp;rsquo;m writing if it is appropriate to the topic at hand.  But I have a weblog, it seems like the appropraite avenue for responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got three comments to make. They are, in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of my &amp;lsquo;overplaying my hand,&amp;rsquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;cited by Ole&lt;/a&gt; in the post that drew my attention to Ian&amp;rsquo;s paper.  This is taken up &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1/#readon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s point that multiple conclusion deductions aren&amp;rsquo;t found in nature.  (This point is, of course, not limited to Rumfitt.  It&amp;rsquo;s found throughout the literature, predominantly in response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;.)  This is taken up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/03/Rumfitt_Part_2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting argument concerning the multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;Cut Rule&lt;/em&gt; being properly stronger than mere transitivity. (This is the point at which the metaphor of the sports car appears.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making all three comments in the one post seems excessive.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll make the first comment here, and leave the other two for later posts in the next little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can tell you &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; story, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tell you &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; story.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn&#34;&gt;&amp;darr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;ret&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  What is multiple conclusion consequence?  It is what is presented in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus for classical logic.  A multiple conclusion consequence links a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of premises &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; with a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of conclusions &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.  We say that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if there&amp;rsquo;s a sequent derivation of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  The soundness and completeness theorem linking Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus to models for classical logic tells us that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if and only if there is no model (and assignment of values to the variables, if we allow free variables in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;) in which each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied and no member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied.   Formally speaking, multiple conclusion consequence is impeccable when it comes to classical logic, and its fragments such as distributive lattice logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my favoured approach (discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;), the multiple conclusion consequence from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; makes &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as saying that a position in which every member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and every member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is self-defeating.  (I&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say about what it is to be self-defeating in the salient sense, below.)  For example, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) entails &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; and yes, asserting the inclusive disjunction of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; while at the very same time denying &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is to make a mistake&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s for the very claims to undercut one another in a very special way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Rumfitt doesn&amp;rsquo;t like this approach. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of the earliest exposition I have given of the ideas, in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  He writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this case for multiple conclusions is presented in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Restall 2005&lt;/a&gt;. But he overplays his hand in suggesting that &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is a multiple-conclusion consequence of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; can be explained as meaning &amp;lsquo;The mental state of accepting all of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting all of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; would be self-defeating&amp;rsquo;. The mental state that consists of accepting that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo;, while rejecting that very statement, is self-defeating. But &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; is in no sense a consequence of &amp;lsquo;There will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;ldquo;There is a god&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: I just don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s premise in the argument.  I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that accepting (a) that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; and (b) rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; are jointly self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, (a) and (b) jointly involve doing something for which there will never be sufficient grounds, but &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; not what is required for self-defeat in anything like any of the senses I was discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice this from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s summary of the position in &amp;ldquo;Multiple Conclusions&amp;rdquo; but I was careful to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; restrict the story of self-defeat (later traded in for the notion of incoherence) to occurrent beliefs or other mental states.  In fact, though I talk about accepting and rejecting in the paper, I was careful to allow that this makes sense even in those cases where we accept claims &lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;for the sake of the argument&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Suppse &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I say.  If you&amp;rsquo;re following along, then under the scope of this supposition, you accept &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.   You reaon &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  If you also accept &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; then, under this scope, it would be a mistake to reject &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  This is clearly something we do, and we want a notion of logical consequence to apply under the scope of such suppositions or hypotheses.  (It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how we could make sense of the rule of conditional proof and what goes on when we reason like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; without some such move.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this discussion, one should never limit accepting and rejecting to occurrent mental states like belief and disbelief.  That will limit the range of applicability of the notion of logical consequence too much.  This was one reason I used &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo;, and why I was careful to also talk of &amp;lsquo;assertion&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;denial&amp;rsquo;, for one can similarly assert under the scope of a supposition, in a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider what we might say about Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case and the position in which I accept that there is not and will never be any sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;There is a god.&amp;rsquo;  OK. Let&amp;rsquo;s, for the sake of the argument, &lt;em&gt;grant&lt;/em&gt; that.  And let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that we &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it.  Now, consider this:  I ask you to consider what would be the case if, as a matter of fact, there were a god.  You are quite well within your rights to say that in that case, there would be a god and that despite that fact, there would still be no grounds for accepting or rejecting the claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think you&amp;rsquo;d be right, and I think that in that discussion, under the scope of that supposition, we have a case where we (conditionally) accept &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo; and accept &amp;lsquo;there is no grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rsquo; and where we do so completely coherently, with no self-defeat at all.  There is something epistemically defective, of course, in thinking that we are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; such a circumstance as described under that supposition.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not required.  That&amp;rsquo;s the joy of assertion and denial, and of accepting and rejecting.  We can make them fly beyond the limits of what we happen to believe (and disbelieve) at the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t accept the premise of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s argument: I submit that it&amp;rsquo;s a too-narrow reading of &amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;rejecting&amp;rsquo; (not allowing enough to count) and a too-wide reading of &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; (allowing too much to count).  If you understand &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;reject&amp;rsquo; broadly enough&amp;mdash;as I think we must&amp;mdash;then the right notion of self-defeat is much easier to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else do I say about the notion of self-defeat?  In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets/&#34;&gt;on this&lt;/a&gt; I have not used the term &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; for it is too easily confused with epistemic notions of assertion without warrant.  (Lloyd Humberstone pointed out a few years ago in conversation that you might worry about Moore paradoxical sentences on my approach, so I have been aware of this issue for some time.)  Instead, I have used the more abstract terms of art such as involving a &amp;lsquo;clash,&amp;rsquo; being &amp;lsquo;incoherent&amp;rsquo; or being &amp;lsquo;out of bounds&amp;rsquo; when talking about positions [&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;] where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.   What is involved in such a clash?  The clash in the assertion of each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and the denial of each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it is, is the kind of clash involved in asserting &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Its normative force, whatever it is, is not just any old force (like that of asserting something for which there is no evidence, or of denying something true).  The connective rules for the sequent calculus show how &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; clashes can be reduced to this basic clash between assertion and denial of the one thing.  Exactly how that reduction goes, and what one can say about the Cut Rule (which also connects clashes with other clashes), I&amp;rsquo;ll leave for another time.  For now, I hope to have shown that Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case, and other Moore paradoxical cases, don&amp;rsquo;t cause any concern for the position in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider other points from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting article, but that seems like enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  I&amp;rsquo;d value feedback on this, as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make sure that the position is &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;convincing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;d settle for &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt; though I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a prize to send to the first person who posts a comment explaining what highbrow cultural reference I just made: the offer is valid for one week, until June 8, 2009.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post the answer if no-one has got it by then. &lt;a href=&#34;#ret&#34;&gt;&amp;uarr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problems for Naïve Property Theories</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/05/21/problems_for_naive_theories_of_properties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about generalisations of Russell&amp;rsquo;s paradox, cleaning things up so you can&amp;rsquo;t get around the problem by changing the logic of connectives. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that mucking around with &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;implication&lt;/em&gt; gets to the heart of the issue.  (This view is shared by some very &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/view?isbn=0262071444&#34;&gt;insightful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11225-009-9177-2&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to it alone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting around negation and conditionals is surprisingly easy, once you get the proof theory sorted out.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling about with this issue for a year or so now.  I presented on this in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;talk at the World Congress of Paraconsistency&lt;/a&gt; last year, and a bit of it has appeared in my draft &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/stp/&#34;&gt;discussion of some themes from Hartry Field&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Saving Truth From Paradox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, the paradoxical derivations are done in sequent calculi, and they&amp;rsquo;re not the most perspicuous presentation.  I managed to sharpen it up a bit tonight, and the resulting proof is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s not explained in the text of that note: that gives just the definitions and the proof. I hope to get to that soon.  But let me use this site to get the ideas out in a rough and ready form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the idea is this.  Folks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Hartry Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; think that for every description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) there&amp;rsquo;s a property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;).  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).  The traditional problem is this: consider the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t instantiate &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;.  Does this instantiate itself or not?  If it does, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions favoured by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Beall&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/&#34;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr&#34;&gt;former self&lt;/a&gt;), though they differ in details, all agree that we should muck around with the logic of negation.  (And also the logic of the conditional, as the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;: if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then I&amp;rsquo;m a monkey&amp;rsquo;s uncle&amp;gt; is just as problematic: see &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/&#34;&gt;Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt; to worry about each different tweak to the logic of negation and the logic of the conditional, and worry about whether this patch or that fix really does solve the problem.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a fun pain, if you like that kind of thing, but a pain nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at formulations of the problem that avoid all talk of negation, conditionals and other stuff my friends and colleagues can argy bargy about.  Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make do with the logic of instantiation (that&amp;rsquo;s implicit in the so-called na&amp;iuml;ve theory of properties, for which each description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) has a corresponding  property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; which is &amp;phi;.  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).)  So, we adopt two inference rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] From &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;) infer &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] From &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; infer &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for each open sentence &amp;phi;(&amp;nbsp;).  (The &amp;lsquo;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rsquo; is our shorthand for &amp;lsquo;instantiates.&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need two more things.  First, a sentence that is pretty bad.  One from which we can infer everything will do the trick.  (If you have a universal quantifier around, &amp;lsquo;everything instantiates everything&amp;rsquo; will do nicely.  But it isn&amp;rsquo;t mandatory.)  In other words, we have a &amp;lsquo;&amp;perp;&amp;rsquo; for which&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  From &amp;perp; infer any sentence you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need the logic of identity for properties.  You need to have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; account of when &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;psi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; for different sentences &amp;phi; and &amp;psi;.  It&amp;rsquo;d be odd to say that the property of being red and square was a different property from the property of being square and red, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?  (The extant na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties say little about this.  The extant consistency or non-triviality proofs for na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties, alas, make different descriptions denote &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; properties, which is not what you should want.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we say that would rule out out distinctions where there is no difference at all?  What identity condition works for this sort of property?  Extensionality is the identity condition for &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;.  If the things in set &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are the same as the things in set &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are the same set.  That&amp;rsquo;s clearly too strong for properties.  (Think renates and cordates, or featherless bipeds and humans.)  But if I can deduce that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and vice versa (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is aribtrary), using deduction alone and no contingent side conditions, then what difference could there be between property &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and property &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;?  None that I can see, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.  This motivates the following condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  If I can deduce &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;, with no other side conditions, discharge those assumptions and infer &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parenthetical remark: that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; mean that being H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is the same property as being water, unless you think you can infer that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is water, and vice versa, using logic alone.  You can think that they are necessarily coextensive without thinking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;re not identifying properties coarsely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] tells us when two properties are identical.  We need to know what we can infer from the claim that two properties are identical.  That seems straightforward.  You only get out what you put in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  From &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, infer &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s five simple inference principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those five inference principles are enough for you to deduce &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bad, since from &amp;perp; one can validly deduce everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we deduce &amp;perp;?  We use identity and &amp;perp; to do what we wanted negation to do before our friends and colleagues said negation didn&amp;rsquo;t do that.  That is, consider &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;perp;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, consider the property of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that the property that anything has when &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates itself as a property is the same thing as the property that nothing has.  (In other words, consider the property of not being self instantiating, but we won&amp;rsquo;t say that, since we have nice arguments about the logic of negation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] alone, we can deduce &amp;perp;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the proof&lt;/a&gt;.  It has fifteen steps, each one of which is one of those five rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a serious problem for anyone who likes na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties.  You&amp;rsquo;ve got to say which of those rules break down: and by &amp;lsquo;break down&amp;rsquo; I mean something very precise.  For which of the rules [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  are you prepared to accept the premise and reject the conclusion?  If you can&amp;rsquo;t do that, then a forced march down &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;the proof&lt;/a&gt; suffices to commit you to &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what will it be?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/05/07/Bob_Meyer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I received the sad news that Bob Meyer, my former colleague at the ANU, and friend, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/strenge&#34;&gt;two-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/desecsed&#34;&gt;collaborator&lt;/a&gt;, died last night, after a long struggle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob will be sorely missed by many of us. His warmth and humour, his brilliance, and his willingness to talk logic (and much more) to anyone and everyone, will all be impossible to replace.  If I manage to show a small fraction of both his logical insight, and his ability to communicate difficult concepts with good humour and wit, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a happy philosophical logician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I&amp;rsquo;m off to Adelaide for one of our many Adelaide&amp;ndash;Melbourne logic weekend funfests. This time it will be a bittersweet occasion, with many opportunities share our stories of the Maximum Leader of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html&#34;&gt;Logicians&amp;rsquo; Liberation League&lt;/a&gt;, and to toast his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, David Chalmers &lt;a href=&#34;http://fragments.consc.net/djc/2009/05/bob-m.html&#34;&gt;remembers Bob fondly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consc.net/cgi-bin/picsearch.pl?keyw=meyer&#34;&gt;links to some photos&lt;/a&gt;, and points to Bob&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2215186&#34;&gt;notorious paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he proves that God&amp;rsquo;s existence is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Bob, for all you&amp;rsquo;ve done for me.  My work and my life has been enriched in having you as a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Allen Hazen pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=67&#34;&gt;this nice interview&lt;/a&gt; Julian Bagnini conducted with Ernie Lepore, on words. Lepore comes to the same sort of conclusion as Kaplan &amp;ndash; that identity conditions for words are tricky.  He&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Types, Tokens and Names</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s quiz&lt;/a&gt; was from the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;http://admin.cdh.ucla.edu/webpage.php?par=98&#34;&gt;David Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, in the article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106880&#34;&gt;Words&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society&lt;/em&gt;, Supplementary Volume, LXIV 1990).  As Robbie mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;in the comments&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a cool paper.  I want to give an example of how cool it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think of &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;, repeatable things that the are, as the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt; inscriptions, jottings, arrangements of pixels, utterances and all of the other kinds of ways we find to express words.  Kaplan argues in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; that this isn&amp;rsquo;t right.  I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the argument here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about one example he gives along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the special case of names.  My name &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; is, in one sense, the same name as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/gregory-currie.php&#34;&gt;Greg Currie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s name &amp;ndash; we share the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo;.  In another sense, in the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Arts-Minds-Gregory-Currie/dp/0199256284/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Arts and Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Introduction-Fundamentals-Greg-Restall/dp/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the two uses of the string &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different names, and different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;.  They don&amp;rsquo;t have the same referent, and hence, they don&amp;rsquo;t have the same meaning.  Saying it like that (without the addition of surnames) is not necessarily the clearest way to say it, but if you get both of us together &amp;ndash; last done in a pub in Nottingham in October 2005 &amp;ndash; you could say exactly those words and make perfectly good, non-confusing sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you might think that the two uses of the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; because they differ in referent, and that the only way two names of the same type could genuinely be &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; (and not one name after all) is that the case is like this &amp;ndash; that they have different referents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Kaplan, in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; gives a delightful counterexample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about the case of the mischievous Babylonian. One evening, the mischievous Babylonian looked up and saw Venus, and he thought to himself &amp;ldquo;This one is just as beautiful as Phosphorus, so let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babylonian names Venus (under the guise of the evening star) &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;in honour&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo;, the morning star, little knowing that he has re-named the one and the same planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think: later, after learning some more celestial mechanics, the astronomer can say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goodness!  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before, but now I see: &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this can make perfect sense as something that was &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that individuating names is not as easy as we might hope. Genealogy, in all is contingent glory, plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it as an exercise to the reader to apply this to the Paderewski case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quiz for today</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is today&amp;rsquo;s quiz question.  Which master of exposition said &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, and where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arguing for years, unconvincingly, that semantic value (properly understood) is not affected by substitution, I hit upon a brilliant, new, and completely successful, strategy: argue, instead, that semantic value &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; affected by substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt;: the quote occurs after in the context of a discussion of proper names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Upon reflection, that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a hint, is it?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post your guess as to who I&amp;rsquo;m quoting, in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today&#34;&gt;comments form on this post&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can post an informed answer too, if you like, but I suspect a guess would be even more fun.)  The most interesting answer will receive a &lt;em&gt;prize&lt;/em&gt; in the honest-to-goodness snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spandrels of Truth</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Whoever thought that teaching in three subjects, chairing one committee, participating in another one with a honking big project to keep on the rails for the next few months, supervising &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; research students (for a seriously large value of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) and trying to keep your research ticking over would keep you busy with work?  I did think that.  But now I know it by acquaintance, and not merely by dispassionate theoretical reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not here to moan.  I&amp;rsquo;m here to make you an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism&#34;&gt;co-author&lt;/a&gt; (more like partner in crime) &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/Site/Home.html&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; has gone and written &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Spandrels of Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  (He&amp;rsquo;s one of these ridiculously prolific authors.)  Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s a cracker of a read, on the view that if we take seriously the idea that to say that &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; is true is no more and no less than to say that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then the inconsistencies like the liar paradox are side-effects of the &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; decisions, just like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel&#34;&gt;spandrels&lt;/a&gt; in architecture, and are neither to be worried about nor gotten rid of: instead, they&amp;rsquo;re to be lived with.  Jc&amp;rsquo;s job is to convince us all of this by supplying us a paraconsistent logic and enough semantic machinery to show that living with them is not going to make the whole building fall down.  I think he does a great job, and that this book is required reading for anyone thinking about theories of truth, paradoxes and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the required reading is not too expensive.  Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/temp/Spandrels.pdf&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; for your ordering, and Oxford University Press will shave 20% off the price.  Go buy it.  Help Jc rocket up the best-seller lists.  But be quick. The 20% discount lasts only until June 11, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in Melbourne.  Z and I have been back for over a week &amp;ndash; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at work since the middle of last week, slowly setting up while Z has been settling into school.  C returns tomorrow, and the place will feel like home at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy blogosphere is all a-flutter with the release of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/&#34;&gt;2009 Leiter Report&lt;/a&gt;.  We have known for some time that the troubles here at Melbourne &lt;a href=&#34;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/biggest-drops-in-overall-ranking-in-the-new-pgr.html&#34;&gt;would impact our rating&lt;/a&gt;  and the result is there for all to see.  We&amp;rsquo;re out of the top ranking in Australia, sinking below Monash in the report&amp;rsquo;s league tables.  Still, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to recognise that in the discipline rankings we&amp;rsquo;re notable in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown12.asp&#34;&gt;Applied Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Feminist Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Mathematical Logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown19.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown5.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophical Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  For a very small core of a department, we do rather well.  We have a very nice group from which to rebuild a decent department &amp;ndash; the trick will be managing the rebuilding phase.  Please wish us luck (or if you can, lend us your support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was wonderful.  I needed the break, and I enjoyed visting Pitt, CMU and UConn (thanks Shawn, Anil, Bob, Nuel, Kevin, Steve, Kohei, Horacio, Jc, Katrina, Marcus, Aaron, Colin, Reed, Michael, Scott, and everyone else, for your hospitality), and we had much fun at each stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, I&amp;rsquo;m back in the saddle, confronted with a heavy class load &amp;ndash; comprising &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/800-123&#34;&gt;first-year logic&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-241&#34;&gt;upper-level logic subject&lt;/a&gt; I affectionately call &amp;ldquo;Kurt G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Hits&amp;rdquo;, and four classes in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-434&#34;&gt;fourth-year seminar on Epistemology and Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about recent work on truthmaking, from Lowe and Rami&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1844651452/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;handy new collection&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; as well as some new postgraduate students (hi, Simon, hi Aaron!), significant administrative repsonsibilities, and writing and editing tasks I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep on the boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, work is busy.  If you&amp;rsquo;re waiting on an email from me, hold on. I&amp;rsquo;m getting to it.  I&amp;rsquo;m knocking the pile down each day, and at the moment, the pile is getting smaller, rather than bigger, so you can expect that I&amp;rsquo;ll get to yours at some time in the finite future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re having a wonderful time on our holiday, cruising through the southwest of the USA.  The sights have been spectacular, varied and unexpected.   The highlight so far was Bryce Canyon.  The Grand Canyon is grand, and sublime in its own way.  Bryce Canyon was totally unexpected: I had no idea erosion could do just &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010494&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Z ran around like a madman enjoying the snow, and the awesome view.  But the highlight for Z has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010250&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;throwing snowballs&lt;/a&gt;, something doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature in the average Melbourne kid&amp;rsquo;s average day.  Bigger photos, for those who want to keep up, are accumulating in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042&#34;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Zion National Park, we&amp;rsquo;re off to Las Vegas.  There, we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to meeting &lt;a href=&#34;http://obscureandconfused.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Frost-Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in our couple of days there.  (As well as the sensory overload of the Strip, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going on a &lt;em&gt;holiday&lt;/em&gt;! Tomorrow at noon, we&amp;rsquo;ll be on a Qantas 747 to LA, and at the other end, the three of us will be enjoying four weeks of break.  It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; time off for all of us, with a few detours for work talks for me (at Pitt, and at UConn) and for Christine (at Harvard, San Diego, Berkeley and maybe Stanford).  It&amp;rsquo;s our &amp;lsquo;consolation tour&amp;rsquo; in place of what was our original plan: a year in the USA, based in Pittsburgh.  That fell through&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s a complicated story, all to do with Melbourne, nothing to do with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitt.edu/~philosop&#34;&gt;Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, where people have been generous, understanding and gracious.  Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not visiting Pitt for a year, but we&amp;rsquo;re touring the US, having a break, seeing the sights (like the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, and Las Vegas) and visiting friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Pittsburgh, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally get to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://indexical.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Shawn&lt;/a&gt; whose blog I&amp;rsquo;ve read for ages, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/people/gupta.html&#34;&gt;Anil&lt;/a&gt;, whose work I&amp;rsquo;ve read and learned from for much longer.   At UConn, I&amp;rsquo;ll catch up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/&#34;&gt;Jc&lt;/a&gt;, which is always a blast, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.uconn.edu/~mar08022/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s moved there.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also got the honour of giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu/lecture.php&#34;&gt;inaugural annual lecture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu&#34;&gt;UConn Logic Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be posting here unless I get web access, and I think that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority on the holiday.  But after I&amp;rsquo;m back in February, I expect to be posting here more often.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Snippets of News</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here are some random, miscellaneous items of news, concerning what&amp;rsquo;s been happening around here, around now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, but lots of fun, to host visitors.  Since just before Christmas, we&amp;rsquo;ve had visits from two good friends (separately) and four family members (one batch of three and one solo), as well as meals with other friends over the Christmas/Summer period.  Much fun was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to share good experiences in Melbourne with family and friends.  Highlights have included Day 2 of the Boxing Day test, &lt;a href=&#34;http://shanewarnethemusical.com.au/&#34;&gt;Shane Warne: the musical&lt;/a&gt;, and an evening watching (or re-watching) the &lt;em&gt;Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt; and singing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally redesigned the site in a way I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see and to use.  &lt;em&gt;Again&lt;/em&gt;.  There are two causes, one proximate, and one more long-term.  The proximate cause was the superabundance of spam to moderate, on my own &lt;a href=&#34;http://segpub.com.au&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.  Logging in and cleaning out spam, arriving at the rate of at least one a minute, was depressing.  So no more hosted weblog software for me.  Instead, this site is now hand crafted on my computer (using &lt;a href=&#34;http://webby.rubyforge.org&#34;&gt;Webby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s been fun to learn &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby-lang.org&#34;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;) and uploaded to the server as a static site.  When I want comments on an item, I can implement them using &lt;a href=&#34;http://intensedebate.com&#34;&gt;intense debate&lt;/a&gt; or some other commenting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more long-term aim of the redesign was to make the information here more accessible.  In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make it easier to browse my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/writing/topics&#34;&gt;papers, categorised by topic&lt;/a&gt; and these &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/&#34;&gt;news items&lt;/a&gt;.  Each news item &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/&#34;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; carry with themselves links to other news items from the same year.  It was dead-simple to code up the scripts to do this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it makes browsing around the past of this weblog a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments haven&amp;rsquo;t been transferred from the old site, yet, but they&amp;rsquo;re on my list of things to do.   I hope you like the new site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year at work, as I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/03/30/were_in_the_news/&#34;&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more going on than that going on. My leave over this summer break has been more than welcome.  I&amp;rsquo;m away from the office for an extended period (for two weeks already, and I return only on February 23).  For some of this leave, starting tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;re going on a trip to the US, to get away from it all.  The fact that we get to be there during Obama&amp;rsquo;s inauguration is a bonus!  More on the trip, in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Merry Christmas, all</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/24/merry_christmas_all/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas break here, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break, with visits from family and friends, and then a trip to the USA for a holiday (and for a couple of little side trips to see friends and give a few talks).  More about that in a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share the Christmas spirit, I&amp;rsquo;ll share a favourite carol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree of life my soul hath seen,&lt;br /&gt;
Laden with fruit and always green:&lt;br /&gt;
The trees of nature fruitless be&lt;br /&gt;
Compared with Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His beauty doth all things excel:&lt;br /&gt;
By faith I know, but ne&amp;rsquo;er can tell&lt;br /&gt;
The glory which I now can see&lt;br /&gt;
In Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For happiness I long have sought,&lt;br /&gt;
And pleasure dearly I have bought:&lt;br /&gt;
I missed of all; but now I see&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;rsquo;Tis found in Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m weary with my former toil,&lt;br /&gt;
Here I will sit and rest awhile:&lt;br /&gt;
Under the shadow I will be,&lt;br /&gt;
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fruit doth make my soul to thrive,&lt;br /&gt;
It keeps my dying faith alive;&lt;br /&gt;
Which makes my soul in haste to be&lt;br /&gt;
With Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is to reboot the blog (and to fix the comment system, which is down for the count just now) for 2009.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see how we go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Always More...</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/09/always_more/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;(What follows is a bundle of ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write up for some time.  Instead of making it a fully fledged paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to rough it out first as a blog post.  If anything comes of it, I&amp;rsquo;ll polish it up.  Let me know what you think.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any possible worlds?  The idea of a &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; in logical space &amp;ndash; at which every proposition is either True or False &amp;ndash; seems at the one and the same time compelling and repellant.  The notion plays a vital role in the semantics of logics of modality and conditionality, and so, is compelling.  It is hard to take modal logic seriously without points in models that play the role of deciding every statement one way other the other.  But to take possible worlds seriously as more than a useful fiction has seemed too great a price for many to pay.  This squeamishness seems, to many, to have a distinctly &amp;lsquo;ontological&amp;rsquo; flavour.  Places at which there are blue swans or in which kangaroos have no tails seems to crowd the halls of being with blue swans and tailless kangaroos.  We would do better without such things if we can.   If we can explain possible worlds away &amp;ndash; as propositions, or stories or abstracta or something else relatively tame &amp;ndash; then we should.  But ontological squeamishness is not my complaint about non-actual possible worlds.  Instead of their non-actuality, my worry about possible worlds is their &lt;em&gt;worldishness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I worry about the way that these infinitely precise &lt;em&gt;points&lt;/em&gt; are then put to use in semantics.  Given that worlds are Deciders of Every Proposition, does it make sense to then turn around and think of a proposition as an arbitrary set of worlds: to think of any set of worlds as the kind of thing that can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a proposition? (David Lewis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=mdVur1qVLr8C&#34;&gt;On the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Chapter 1) is a very good defence of this position, but it is not just his. The view is everywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to explain why this might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grant you: worldlike entities are rife in the study of logics.  Tarski&amp;rsquo;s models for the first-order predicate logic decide every statement in the language as either true or false.  A model is worldlike because it provides consistent and complete scenario, down to the finest detail the language can muster.  It seems inherent in the very notion of classical logic, with its two valued semantics.  Since every statement is either true or false, a world is exactly the kind of think we seem to be talking about when we use some arrangement of truth values consistent with the rules of the logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe this is not how we need to think about things: consider the case of classical propositional logic, and think back to how you were taught truth tables.  To show that &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is a tautology, you showed that it received the value &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt; in every row of a truth table.  Now, how many rows did you use? Hopefully, &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;, one for each different possible assignment of &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; to the sentence letters &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  Any fewer than four rows would have left out some possibilities you should have checked, and any more than four rows would have been more than you needed to look at.  The truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; depends only on the truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, and not on the Values of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; or any other sentence letter.  You check the value of your sentence not at a &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, but at a row of a truth table which is a much blunter instrument: it cares not about most of the sentences in the language.  It knows just enough to decide the truth of the sentences in its remit, in this case, sentences formed out of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, so for every sentence.  Assuming that the stock of sentence letters is boundless (say, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;) &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; sentence will exhaust the vocabulary.  Each sentence can be decided by a row of a truth table, and no (finite) truth table will decide every sentence.  Each sentence in the vocabulary of propositional logic is finite, and so, no matter how long it goes on, there is always more vocabulary left to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can formalise this. For any sentence &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, let #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be the first sentence letter not included in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  So, #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are related in interesting ways.  In particular, if you can show that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any row of a truth table where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true is one where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true too, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.  Why?  Since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is a sentence letter not occurring in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, the absence of a row in which &lt;em&gt;#A&lt;/em&gt; is true and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; false means that there&amp;rsquo;s no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  It&amp;rsquo;s a tautology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we have three more facts like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where, in general, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; holds when there is no row of a truth table where each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is true and each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is false.   In general, if there is no row of the table where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false) and where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false, also) then there is no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false, since the value of #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is completely independent from the value of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;?  It encodes the idea of indefinite extensibility: no matter what our sentence says, there is always something more to say.  (Call these four conditions the &lt;em&gt;rules of extensibility&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;, then if there are possible worlds, not every set of possible worlds counts as a proposition.   Here is why.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of possible worlds, and take a particular world &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;.  If {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is a proposition, what about #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}?  Since {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t contradictory (it&amp;rsquo;s true &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, namely, at &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;), we don&amp;rsquo;t have {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6; #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}, and similarly, we don&amp;rsquo;t have #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;},{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6;.  In other words, we need somewhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t, and we need somwhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} are both true.  That&amp;rsquo;s impossible.  There&amp;rsquo;s only one place {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true, namely &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if singletons of worlds are propositions, then there is no operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;. (There is a dual argument concerning complement propositions, which are true at every world except for one.  They cause just as much havoc to &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have indefinite extensibility for propositions, then no statement can single out a world, for that would be a &amp;ldquo;final proposition&amp;rdquo; for which no extensibility is possible.  If for every proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we can find some proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; independent of it, possible worlds are always idealisations, out of reach of a proposition.  We can always &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; worlds relative to a given vocabulary, but if vocabularies an be extended, what we take to be a world is really a collection of worlds, to be further subdivided as new vocabulary is added.  If &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is an operator, not all set of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; (those infinitely precise &amp;ldquo;Deciders of Every Proposition&amp;rdquo;) count as a proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that would be all well and good, if there were an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.  Is there any operator like it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not: the first problem is that &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as it stands is not really an operator or a connective like &amp;lsquo;&amp;not;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;and;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;or;&amp;rsquo;, since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; depends on how &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is presented.  For example, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) should be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could smooth this wrinkle by defining &amp;lsquo;#&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; to be not the first sentence letter not occuring in &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but rather, the first sentence letter not occuring in any sentence &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  In that case, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, so that is better.  But now the question must remain: if &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is a genuine operator we can nest it: what is ##&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;? It is the first sentence letter not occurring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.   Consider ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first sentence letter not occuring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is, of course, p&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, since #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to itself, and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur in #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  But on the other hand, #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; should really be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; itself!  Perhaps &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; works as a way to transform sentences into other sentences, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thought of as an operator like the logical connectives.  Maybe it cannot be coherently defined in such a way to satisfy the four rules of extensibility.  Maybe there is no threat to propositions as arbitrary sets of infinitely precise worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem like that, but to conclude that there is no &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; would be wrong.  Although the definition of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; in terms of sentence letters is dubious, and does not give rise to a coherent operator when we attempt to nest it, it turns out that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; model a connective satisfying the rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think in terms of worlds, to start.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; as the irrational numbers in the Real Line.  The propositions at &lt;em&gt;Level n&lt;/em&gt;  are the unions of the any selection of irrational intervals of length &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is an integer.  These are closed under union (the union of any collections of intervals is a collection of intervals), intersection (there is no worry about endpoints of abutting intervals, as these don&amp;rsquo;t reach their endpoints, which are rational) and complement (the complement of some collection of intervals is the collection of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; intervals: since the endpoints are rational, they don&amp;rsquo;t occur in either a set or its complement).  The propositions at each level are &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; classifications of points than at any of the previous level.  Propositions at Level 0 are collections of intervals such as (-2,-1), (0,1), (3,4), etc.  Propositions at Level 1 are collections of &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; intervals (-1.5,-1), (1.5,2), (3,3.5), etc., and so on&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s interpret sentences in the language of propositional logic &amp;ndash; enhanced with the operator &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; as propositions at &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level or other.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, then &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;and;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;or;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are also interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, since the union, intersection or complement of propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; are also at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is interpreted as a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, we will choose a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1.  In particular, we will choose an &lt;em&gt;alternating&lt;/em&gt; proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1: the proposition consisting of all of the intervals (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is even integer.  The alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-4,-3) &amp;cup; (-2,-1) &amp;cup; (0,1) &amp;cup; (2,3) &amp;cup; (4,5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-2,-1.5) &amp;cup; (-1,-0.5) &amp;cup; (0,0.5) &amp;cup; (1,1.5) &amp;cup; (2,2.5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on.  It turns out that this choice for #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; satisfies the four rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted as a proposition at level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true everywhere, then it is false at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Now consider #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  It is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  Similarly, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not false everywhere, it is true at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  In other words, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is truly independent of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is completely general.  We for any proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we have found another proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is more finely grained than &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, and the four rules of extensibility are satisfied.  In models like these, it makes sense to think of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as an operator on propositions, and not merely a syntactic device for constructing sentences from other sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to worlds in these models is not essential:  we refrain from all talk of worlds and appeal instead to &lt;em&gt;regions&lt;/em&gt; in a formal topological space.  The definition of propositions in terms of sets of points &amp;ndash; irrational numbers in our case &amp;ndash; is not essential.  The construction gives us an atomless boolean algebra, and these are well known algebraic structures.  The value of the relatively concrete construction here is the manner in which extensibility corresponds to propositions being more and more finely grained, without that ever coming to an end.  The model shows that the idea of indefinite extensibility of propositions is coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell if there are there any possible worlds, and if there are, if arbitrary sets of them count as propositions.   What I can say, however, is that if there is indefinite extensibility, such as expressed by &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and the logic of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is coherent &amp;ndash; then not all sets of worlds are propositions.  For any proposition, there is always more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to Lloyd Humberstone, who got me first thinking about #, at a Melbourne Logic Seminar in 2006.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are, of course, most welcome.  Is this crazy?  Sensible?  Anodyne?  Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Assertion, Denial and Non-Classical Theories</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll with the writing: I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get another paper converted from slides-from-a-talk to real, live, words on a page and actual &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  The paper I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the last couple of days is from my presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; on non-classical theories like non-classical theories of numbers, classes, or truth.  I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with this one, as it&amp;rsquo;s an application of my recent work &amp;ndash; on proof theory &amp;ndash; to a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;, non-classical theories like na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes or of truth.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I urge friends of truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts &amp;ndash; proponents of paracomplete and paraconsistent logics &amp;ndash; to consider theories not merely as sets of sentences, but as &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of sets of sentences, or what I call &amp;lsquo;bitheories,&amp;rsquo; which keep track not only of what &lt;em&gt;holds&lt;/em&gt; according to the theory, but also what &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt; to hold according to the theory.  I explain the connection between bitheories, sequents, and the speech acts of assertion and denial. I illustrate the usefulness of bitheories by showing how they make available a technique for characterising different theories while abstracting away from logical vocabulary such as connectives or quantifiers, thereby making theoretical commitments independent of the choice of this or that particular non-classical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples discussed include theories of numbers, classes and truth.  In the latter two cases, the bitheoretical perspective brings to light some heretofore unconsidered puzzles for friends of na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is a turnabout for me. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a slow turn for some time, from being a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;friend of na&amp;iuml;ve set theory in paraconsistent logics&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr/&#34;&gt;friend of truth-value gaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics&#34;&gt;over gluts&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/costing/&#34;&gt;friendly critic of non-classical approaches to things like Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  In this paper, I present what I take to be much more problematic paradoxes around Frege&amp;rsquo;s Law (V), for which connectives like negation and the conditional do not feature at all, so questions of the design of the non-classical logic of negation or of the conditional are beside the point when it comes to the paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d very much appreciate feedback on this paper.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this sort of thing, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/adnct.pdf&#34;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;post your comments on the paper&amp;rsquo;s page, over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Truth Values and Proof Theory</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to get back into writing.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;Truth Values and Proof Theory&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long time.  I presented a research seminar on this material last year &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to write it up, due to other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I present an account of truth values for classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and the modal logic S5, in which truth values are not a fundamental category from which the logic is defined, but rather, feature as an idealisation of more fundamental logical features arising out of the proof theory for each system.  The result is not a new set of semantic structures, but a new understanding of how the existing semantic structures may be understood in terms of a more fundamental notion of logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like these results, as they&amp;rsquo;re a mix of motivating philosophy, and formal proofs.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting a better understanding of the relationship between the [&lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt;] rule in a sequent calculus and the &lt;em&gt;maximality&lt;/em&gt; conditions involved in the behaviour of things like two-valued evaluations, possible worlds and points in model structures for other sorts of logics.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence that sequents have two sides, and that there are two truth values.   I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve plumbed the depth of the connections between proof theory and model theory, but at the very least in writing this paper up I&amp;rsquo;ve got a better idea of some of the interesting questions around this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;lsquo;bonus&amp;rsquo; results that I&amp;rsquo;ve got out of this research a uniform way of proving completeness for classical logic, Kripke and Beth models for intuitionistic logic, and universal models for S5, all with exactly the same sort of structure.  That was a surprise to me when I saw those results just fall out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments on the paper, of course, are welcome.  Don&amp;rsquo;t comment on it here, but on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got to figure out how to massage these results into &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp/&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a pity my backlog of other writing-up tasks is so long, but that seems to be the natural state of the academic these days.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My trip to Guangzhou was super.  Thanks, Guoxin, Min and Xuefeng for looking after me and showing me the sights of Guangzhou, and to Professors Ju and Zhu for the invitation.  It was a wonderful experience for me, and I look forward to many more visits to China, and to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been off to Canberra for a little workshop on hyperintensionality, organised by David Chalmers.  Much fun was had there, too, but I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m even more confused than I was when I started.  It must have been all that talking to Max Cresswell, Lloyd Humberstone and John Bigelow about how semantics works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of this site seems to be travel announcements, so rather than break the trend, I&amp;rsquo;ll post another travel announcement. On Sunday, I&amp;rsquo;m off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.html&#34;&gt;Sun Yat-Sen University&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/Article/xueshuxinxi/jididongtai/200811/681.html&#34;&gt;give three lectures on my research&lt;/a&gt;.  This is my first trip to China, so I&amp;rsquo;m more excited (and more nervous) than usual for an overseas trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Days #3 and #4</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/09/01/tartu_pluralism_days_3_and_4/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;! What a long rest-of-the conference!  I&amp;rsquo;m now back in Tallinn, after the rest of the conference: 5 talks on Day 3, and one wrapup talk on Day 4.  My comments concerning Days 3 and 4 will not be as extensive as those for Days 1 and 2.  I liked these as much as the earlier talks &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just that my stamina has flagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-3:6a1d5811fed0537efcada76d38072369&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day kicked off with &lt;em&gt;Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&lt;/em&gt; presenting &amp;lsquo;Is Logic about Consequence?&amp;rsquo;  I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed finally getting the opportunity to hear Per speak, as his view of logical consequence &amp;ndash; a particular constructive type theory in which proof objects play a central role &amp;ndash; has always fascinated me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not looked into it in any depth.  Per argued that logic is not primarily about consequence, but must be also about the act of inference, and that distinguishing content and force in the judgement helps us understand the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is clearly right, and in my work since the &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/em&gt; book I&amp;rsquo;ve started to attend to these issues.  In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I attended to the connection between valid sequents and the acts of assertion and denial.    While the account I give there is not one that Per would endorse, the constellation of issues connecting content and force, and the correctness of the steps we make in inferring conclusions from premises, are certainly in the domain of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we had &lt;em&gt;Dag Westerst&amp;aring;hl&lt;/em&gt; with &amp;lsquo;Sources of Plurality.&amp;rsquo;  In this talk, Dag started off with our analysis of logical consequence as truth preservation in cases &amp;ndash; and distinguished this from interpretational accounts, in which it is &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; that counts, not hypothetical truth-in-some-case.  Consequence differs from &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; consequence by the choice of logical vocabulary to keep fixed, and to vary the other vocabulary arbitrarily.  Varying the choice of vocabulary gives you a range of different consequence relations. Dag had interesting results showing how to construct the vocabulary from the consequence relation rather than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we had &lt;em&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n Rayo&lt;/em&gt; working &amp;lsquo;Towards a Trivialist Account of Logic.&amp;rsquo; This wasn&amp;rsquo;t really about &lt;em&gt;pluralism&lt;/em&gt; as such, but rather, was about one sort of account of logical truths as statements which are, in a certain sense, &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt;, those statements whose denial is &lt;em&gt;unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;.  Agust&amp;iacute;n connected the notion of intelligibility with identity (he argued that if you take &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; to be identical to &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, then the &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; consideration of a case where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; will strictly speaking be unintelligible) with modality (understood as truth in all intelligible scenarios) and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting trinity of considerations, and most interesting for me was the methodological points Agust&amp;iacute;n made about the kinds of &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; we have in forming vocabulary.  The more identities we endorse, then the more scenarios become unintelligible, and the more &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions we cannot answer.  (According to Agust&amp;iacute;n there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; answer to the question of why water is H2O, or why Hesperus is Phosphorous.)  On the other hand, the more identities we endorse, the more consequences are derivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n was followed by &lt;em&gt;Marcus Rossberg&lt;/em&gt;  with &amp;lsquo;Pluralism about Logic Proper,&amp;rsquo; in which Marcus wanted to reconcile a Fregean view taking the topic-neutrality of logic seriously, with the pluralist sympathies of Carnap.  Marcus developed the idea of a &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;, for which different logics may be appropriate (say, constructive mathematics; quantum objects; etc.) and attempted to reconcile pluralism with a proper &amp;lsquo;lower limit&amp;rsquo; logic which is most general and applicable for all topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 3 was wrapped up by &lt;em&gt;Dag Prawitz&lt;/em&gt; who presented &amp;lsquo;Kinds of Pluralism in Logic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag&amp;rsquo;s talk started off with an excellent summary of the kind of logical pluralism favoured by JC and me, and then he proceeded to inquire about what logic ought to say about an inference: a transition to a conclusion &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;, etc. He did not think that either of the claims made in the book &amp;ndash; (1) that if an argument is invalid then the inference from premises to conclusion makes a mistake or (2) that if an argument is valid, then it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to assert the premises and deny the conclusion &amp;ndash; sufficed to give an account of what is going on.  Dag&amp;rsquo;s preferred story is that valid arguments provide a way to transform the grounds of the premises into a ground for the conclusion, and that if an argument is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the infer-er can use the argument to supply the ground for the conclusion of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about this view, I think.  It has an account of where the difference lies in knowing that an argument is valid, by showing that this gives you a means to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; from the premises to the conclusion, and there are very well developed theory of proofs (say, Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&amp;rsquo;s proof objects or realisability semantics, or some other theory) which can give us accounts of the structures of such grounds and the way we can manipulate them (by taking them &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; in pairs; by &lt;em&gt;applying&lt;/em&gt; one to another in &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag thought that this removed the need/desire for plurality, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about this.  It seems to me that you could accept this, and think that there was a plurality, say, between deductive conseqence and formal consequence; and between classical formal consequence and intuitionist formal consequence; and perhaps also into relevant consequence &amp;mdash; if one had different accounts of what were allowable techniques for transforming one ground into another.  Mathematical reasoning, for example, uses &lt;em&gt;recursion&lt;/em&gt; as a technique for constructing a new ground out of old grounds, and this does not play a role in purely formal logical consequence. You might also say that classical reasoning uses a technique for constructing grounds (continuations, in the double-negation translation, or something more complicated with positive and negative &amp;lsquo;grounds&amp;rsquo; in a symmetric proof system) that are not permitted with intuitionist ground-formation.  The pluralist view of the move from premise to conclusion remains, but translated here into a very different key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s lots more to think about here, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to attempting to work some of it out, to see if the sketches I&amp;rsquo;m making here actually bear fruit.  If you do any thinking on these issues &amp;ndash; and get anywhere with them &amp;ndash; please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-4:6a1d5811fed0537efcada76d38072369&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on Sunday, we wrapped up with one talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;JC Beall&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;lsquo;Logical Pluralism, Validity and Truth-Preservation.&amp;rsquo; Here, JC brought together his interest in the paradoxes and the logical pluralism with the negative result to the effect that truth-in-a-case can&amp;rsquo;t be identified with truth (in the actual world) for Curry-paradoxical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this &amp;ndash; primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have settled ideas of what to think about truth.  It did convince me that it&amp;rsquo;s important to sort this out and be clear on the nature and properties of truth and its connections with logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it!  It was a wonderful conference &amp;ndash; Daniel, Marcus and Peter did a wonderful job organising, and we all enjoyed ourselves immensely.  It was good to catch up with old friends and to make new ones.  I&amp;rsquo;ve left with lots more things to think about, and some new ways to do that thinking.  You can&amp;rsquo;t ask for anything more from a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this final report late in the evening in Tallinn.  Tomorrow I take the long journey back to Melbourne, via Amsterdam and Singapore.  Hopefully these conference reports have been useful if you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to come to the conference.  Writing them helped me collect my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #2</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/29/tartu_pluralism_day_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2008 17:46:48 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/29/tartu_pluralism_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;OK, it&amp;rsquo;s a short day here today &amp;ndash; thankfully, since I&amp;rsquo;m knackered after Day #1 &amp;ndash; with two talks.  Last night we dined at an Italian Restaurant, and I learned more about &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dutilh/articles/swyneshed.pdf&#34;&gt;Roger Swyneshed&lt;/a&gt; from Stephen Read, than I ever expected to learn.  Talks today are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter Pagin&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;em&gt;Universalist and Actualist Consequence&lt;/em&gt;.  Peter connected his work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~kgl/kathrin.htm&#34;&gt;Kathrin Gl&amp;uuml;er&lt;/a&gt; on relational modality and the semantics of names with considerations concerning the difference between universal validity (truth in all possible worlds whatsoever) and actualist validity (truth in all candidate actual worlds &amp;ndash; down the diagonal in a 2D semantics, for example). He indicated that his looks like our distinction, both should count as validity notions which ought to be endorsed.  Peter wondered whether this was a problem, and whether there&amp;rsquo;s a conflict between endorsing universalist validity and actualist validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good question: I think that this is a good case where being a pluralist makes sense: if we think of validity as classifying deduction steps into those that are valid and those that aren&amp;rsquo;t, then actualist and universalist validity notions have their place.  Take the step from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;.  This is OK in one obvious sense (we&amp;rsquo;d make a mistake to assert &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and deny &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;), and bad in another (that step doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if we are under a counterfactual assumption &amp;ndash; we grant that &lt;em&gt;not p&lt;/em&gt;, and then consider what would have happened were &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; the case &amp;ndash; we can&amp;rsquo;t infer from that to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More must be done, of course, on what it is to &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; the logic, and to say why we might like to have both of these criteria in our toolkit.  I think we do want both, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think that arguing abou which of these is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;deductive validity&amp;rsquo; is fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next talk is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johan van Benthem, for whom &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism Meets Logical Dynamics&lt;/em&gt;.  Johan kicked off by addressing the issue of what logic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, noting that &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;computation&lt;/em&gt;, which are equally important.  Logical systems are neat&amp;ndash;they do all these things.  In the talk, rich with different ideas, the focus was on the &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; treatment of logic, of proof and deduction.  The thought is simple, but the consequences are rich: thinking of announcements as acts in which the space of possibilities is narrowed down, we can think of the argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; when after announcing &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; (in that order), the announcement that &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; would be redundant.  The neat thing here is that Knower-paradoxical announcements (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; but you don&amp;rsquo;t know that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) have interesting logical properties such that announcing them &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; has a different effect than announcing them once.  There are clearly different notions of information processing and deduction in play here, and as always, Johan&amp;rsquo;s work is rich with ideas and consequences for many people to work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that the paper this talk was based on will be appearing in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with commentaries by others, too.  So hopefully, that will bring the dynamic epistemic approach into conversation with other traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after lunch, we&amp;rsquo;re off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=estonia&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=58.525257,27.498779&amp;amp;spn=1.827038,3.339844&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=8&#34;&gt;the lake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #1</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2008 23:57:40 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re coming semi-live from Tartu, as long as my computer&amp;rsquo;s battery lasts, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For live off-the-cuff comments, try my experimental &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;, which is profoundly silly, but fun to fiddle with on my phone when my fingers are itchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, giving &amp;ldquo;Pluralism and Proofs.&amp;rdquo;  I think I went well.  Look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2008/08/sneak-preview-greg-restall-on-logical.html&#34;&gt;Ole&amp;rsquo;s sneak-preview of what I said&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty-well what I said here.  The fact that Dag Prawitz and Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f didn&amp;rsquo;t eat me alive, but were actually interested, was profoundly reassuring.  I&amp;rsquo;ve only done the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/pluralism_and_proofs_[slides].pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, not a written version of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Priest on &amp;ldquo;Logical Pluralism as another application of Chunk-and-Permeate.&amp;rdquo;  This is an interesting project, conceiving of logic&amp;rsquo;s application to a domain of reasoning as variegated &amp;ndash; a domain of discourse can be &amp;lsquo;chunked&amp;rsquo; into different bits, where different logics are operative, and then &amp;lsquo;permeation&amp;rsquo; relations tell us how facts in one chunk transfer over to facts in another.  Graham was using this general setup (which he introduced in earlier work with Bryson Brown, on the infinitesimal calculus &amp;ndash; one chunk is where the infinitesimal is zero, another chunk is where it&amp;rsquo;s nonzero, and you only permeate facts about non-infinitesimals, or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham&amp;rsquo;s take on pluralism here is that you can think of the different chunks as different kinds of things we&amp;rsquo;re reasoning about: quantum objects (with their quantum logic) and middle-sized dry goods and their non-quantum (say, classical logic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this application is really interesting, and it&amp;rsquo;s not what we (JC and I) talking about in our pluralism.  We&amp;rsquo;re pluralists about the logic used for evaluating &amp;ldquo;reasoning about&amp;rdquo; the same collections of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top question (or was it three?) came from Johan van Benthem, who pointed out the parallel with channel theory (I should have warned Graham about that because I should have spotted that!), and interesting applications in database combination, and legal reasons why information maybe shouldn&amp;rsquo;t flow from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After lunch, it&amp;rsquo;s Stephen Read and &amp;ldquo;General-Elimination Harmony and the Meaning of the Logical Constants,&amp;rdquo; which sounds like a good name for a bad cover band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all about &lt;em&gt;general elimination harmony&lt;/em&gt;: the notion that we can take the introduction rule for a connective as defining it, and a general elimination rule (defined in a systematic way,  at least for simple cases of introduction rules) can be reconstructed out of the introduction rule if that connective is to be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;connective&amp;rdquo; (in shudder quotes, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; anything) is the bullet (or blob) &amp;ndash; &amp;bull; &amp;ndash; with the introduction rule allowing us to infer &amp;bull; from a proof from &amp;bull; to absurdity.  He showed that one could define an appropriate general elimination rule in harmony with that introduction rule.  So it&amp;rsquo;s OK in some sense &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s harmonious &amp;mdash; but not a conservative extension of the underlying pre-&amp;bull; consequence relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then went on to talk of the application of these notions to modality (which I&amp;rsquo;d heard from Stephen before in the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004787622057&#34;&gt;Harmony and Autonomy in Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;), but then he went on to talk of conditionality.  Here, the discussion took an interesting turn, for Stephen pointed out that the necessary discussion of structural rules (which came up in the discussion of conjunction, disjunction, etc).  Ringing the changes on this &amp;ndash; or at least attending to questions about contraction and weakening &amp;ndash; give us a way to understand the logical behaviour of conditionality, for the structural rules feature prominently in the behaviour of the conditional rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was fun, even more fun happened in discussion, with zingers of questions from Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f and Dag Prawitz.  Per pushed on the definition of the blob &amp;ndash; this definition literally makes no sense for Per, because for Per, you can&amp;rsquo;t prove that &amp;bull; is a proposition.  This is right, and it helped bring out the difference between Per&amp;rsquo;s constructive type theory and Stephen&amp;rsquo;s logic. Then Dag Prawitz pointed out that the choice of structural rules cannot be arbitrary, but must be constrained in some way: what is the ground for choosing one set of structural rules rather than another.  Stephen indicated that this is a really interesting question worth sorting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then next, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/&#34;&gt;Manuel Bremer&lt;/a&gt;, presenting &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/Logic/Pluralism.pdf&#34;&gt;What is Logical Pluralism?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; He argued that our logical pluralism is not clear, and if it&amp;rsquo;s clear, it&amp;rsquo;s either not true, or not interesting.  This sounds ominous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;ominous&lt;/em&gt;.  It was a lovely example of how &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; perspectives on what logic is (or does) result in making pluralism look very implausible.  Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point was that logic has something to do with cognitive architecture&amp;ndash;in particular, that inferences arising out of generative grammar rules&amp;ndash;are genuinely valid, and that logic deviating from that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a grip on &lt;em&gt;what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I think, given the starting point, but I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point.  This means, of course, that I should say something about the connection is between cognitive architecture and logical validity.  Yes, I should.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t said much, except to say that the connection between deductive consequence relations and the &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; one does or should make are generally complicated matters, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/inference_vs_im_1.html&#34;&gt;the usual Harman-esque reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion, I must admit, got quite pointed at times, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect when people disagree about fundamental issues, and want to sort out where you disagree.  It was all in good fun, and Manuel sweetly came up to me afterwards to say &amp;ldquo;I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t offended.&amp;rdquo;  Of course I wasn&amp;rsquo;t, and as Johan van Bentham mentioned in discussion time, Manuel lavished us with attention to bring out why so much of JC&amp;rsquo;s and my take on logical pluralism is wrong-headed from his view, and so much critical attention is &amp;ndash; indeed &amp;ndash; a form of praise.  Too right it is!  Thanks, Manuel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last up for today, Hartry Field, trying to find an &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; logical pluralism.   (The requirement for finding &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; views is a bit of a running joke here.)  I&amp;rsquo;ll write this up later when I recharge the battery on my computer.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a minute remaining on the battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m back.  Hartry&amp;rsquo;s talk featured lots of interesting concerns I can&amp;rsquo;t recount here (neither the time nor the space), but he major point for me was his connection between the notion of logical validity and constraint of degrees of belief.  Hartry argues (as he did in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures&#34;&gt;Locke lectures&lt;/a&gt;) that if one takes the inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; should be no higher than the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; (and this generalises for arguments with more premises), and that you &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; take validity to be necessary truth preservation, for this ensnares you in paradox.  Then since validity is a normative notion, and since Hartry thinks we should be anti-realists about norms, there is room for a kind of plurality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is not much room for plurality where it&amp;rsquo;s exciting, as far as Hartry can see, since that kind of wiggle room isn&amp;rsquo;t there when it comes to truth value gaps and truth value gluts.  The disagreement between a gap view and a glut view and classical view isn&amp;rsquo;t up for pluralism on this account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s completely right, by my lights. My disagreement with Graham Priest over whether or not a liar sentence is both true and false is not up for a pluralist reconciliation.  We just disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I think there&amp;rsquo;s scope for more work is the nature of the norms, and whether or not the connection between degree-of-belief management and deductive validity is two way, or only one way.  Is an argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; valid (or we know it&amp;rsquo;s valid, or whaever) &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; and only if we ought regulate our degree of belief to have &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) never over &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)?  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s right, but making the case for this &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt; requires close attention to what an attribution of degrees of belief involves, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If this is Thursday, it must be Tartu.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; starts today, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m up first&lt;/a&gt;.  The nerves have started to jangle just a bit, since the audience is about as high-powered as any in my experience at international conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just as well as those who intimidate me the most this time around (due to their all-round awesomeness combined with the fact that this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve met them) &amp;ndash; Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f,  Dag Prawitz and Johan van Benthem &amp;ndash; are uniformly warm and personable. (I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if that will make it better or worse when the knife gets sunk in to my position.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on time, attention and lots of other factors, I&amp;rsquo;ll try blogging a bit from the conference, though I won&amp;rsquo;t promise to keep up through the entire thing.  So, if you&amp;rsquo;re here and I don&amp;rsquo;t mention &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; presentation, please don&amp;rsquo;t hold that against me.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to keep your attention up over an entire conference, let alone write something sensible, meaningful and worth-posting-on-the-internet about each and every talk at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk starts in roughly three hours from now.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amsterdam!</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Amsterdam.  Getting here was touch-and-go.  My decent wait between my Melbourne &amp;rarr; Singapore flight and my Singapore &amp;rarr; Amsterdam leg whittled down to around 45 minutes.  That involved a trek through the terminal, a tense wait at Transfer Desk C (where people in the queue in front of me were arguing with the staff about visas, and people behind me were concerned that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get on the flight &amp;ndash; and were expressing this concern, rather vocally).  I got there in the end, but it was a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Highlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;?  Reading 100 pages of Anil Gupta&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;Empricism and Experience&lt;/a&gt;.  This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good.  It&amp;rsquo;s (1) logically sharp, (2) applied to philosophical issues of deep concern and most interestingly (3) original and creative, and enlightening.   He cuts at deep issues with classical empiricism, at a level of abstraction that &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m convinced &amp;ndash; gets to the heart of the matter in a new and illuminating way.  Characterising classical empiricism as the result of a number of theses concerning what is given in experience (that it&amp;rsquo;s propositional, veridical, and multiply factorisable), and that this combination &amp;ndash; rather than the argument from Illusion and the debate surrounding this &amp;ndash; that dooms classical empiricism to never explain the epistemic success we have. It&amp;rsquo;s rigourous, illuminating and spot on.  (Oh, and the comments on Quine &amp;ndash; to the effect that accepts exactly the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; parts of classical empiricism, to betray naturalism for a kind of idealism &amp;ndash; alone are worth the price of admission.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now that when I grow up I want to be able to think and write like Anil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;? Having my order for an Asian Vegetarian meal ignored by KLM at one meal.  When I mentioned to the steward that this salad didn&amp;rsquo;t look very vegetarian (with the chicken and all), &amp;ndash; and that I had ordered a vegetarian meal when I booked my flight &amp;ndash; she apologised, and got me a replacement salad.  It looked like a very odd potato salad.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t place where I&amp;rsquo;d seen potato sliced so thinly in a potato salad, but there was so much mayonnaise that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell.  What I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell, of course, was that it was a salad whose principle ingredient (well, competing with the mayonnaise) was ham.  That&amp;rsquo;s a salad that vegetarians, Muslims and Jews can all get behind!  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the flight was fine.  I use flights to sleep, read, and while having meals, catch up on my trashy movie viewing. This time, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/&#34;&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/&#34;&gt;The Bank Job&lt;/a&gt;.  Both were enjoyable in a throwaway sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at Schiphol for longer than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to, waiting for my bag to catch up, strolled around the city, and pored over Dutch Masters at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl&#34;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some more exploration to do this evening, and then tomorrow too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Bag packed, ticket &amp;amp; passport at the ready, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/macbookpro&#34;&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; charged, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/iphone&#34;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; charged and synced, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Colossians-Remixed-Subverting-Brian-Walsh/dp/0830827382/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; located, papers to read/referee/assess all printed or downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be going on a flight.  The trip takes me from Melbourne to Singapore to Amsterdam to Tallinn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt;, and then I retrace my steps to get back here in ten days.  That&amp;rsquo;s too much plane and airport time for my money, but I fully expect that &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; will be worth the discomfort.  Oh, the day-and-a-bit stopover in Amsterdam should &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl/&#34;&gt;be worth it too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pain, stress, redundancies, another day at the office</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2008 10:35:03 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I had thought that we (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Faculty of Arts&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;) were trying to keep our difficulties an internal affair, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/arts-renewal/workforce-proposal.html&#34;&gt;apparently we&amp;rsquo;re not&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that this is all public news, I suppose I could comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-home-message from this memo from the Dean: (1) The budget in the Arts Faculty is not yet in the black, though it&amp;rsquo;s getting better, and (2) The plan is for more voluntary &amp;lsquo;redundancies&amp;rsquo; (this is now Round 3), this time with the shadow of involuntary redundancies is we don&amp;rsquo;t get enough voluntary ones to right the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discipline of Philosophy took an almighty hit at the end of Round 1. At the end of 2007 we had 5 departures out of a full-time teaching staff of 10.5.  So we&amp;rsquo;ve done rather more than our part of the deal in righting the budgetary situation &amp;ndash; except for the very real problem of &amp;lsquo;overcorrecting,&amp;rsquo; making it rather &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to teach a coherent Philosophy major in the BA (with keen, bright students ready to learn), supervise our wonderful graduate students, and get research done.   There are so few philosophers left, this round of redundancies is not directed at us, but we feel for our colleagues down the corridors, and across the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future for us is murky, but at least there&amp;rsquo;s very real prospect for rebuilding once the rest of the Faculty has sorted out its bottom line.  In the near term we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; creative to get enough bodies on the ground to do our jobs well.  We&amp;rsquo;re looking at other sources of funding, grants, bringing people on research fellowships, etc.  That&amp;rsquo;s all good, but of course, what we most need is a stable core group of people to teach and research and run the place.  In this environment, with the best will in the world from colleagues, it&amp;rsquo;s still touch and go as to how we get through it.  The next few months are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather out-of-communication on the website for the last months.  Both figuring out how to we philosophers at Melbourne work through this, and managing the stress it&amp;rsquo;s been causing has been a struggle.  (Ask my long-suffering spouse and child&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Out of the five Australians who were chosen as nominating editors of this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophersannual.org/&#34;&gt;Philosophers&amp;rsquo; Annual&lt;/a&gt;, four are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;The University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  The lucky 4 are Hazen, Schroeter (Fran&amp;ccedil;ois), Schroeter (Laura), and Restall.  (The other Australian is David Chalmers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 out of 28 is a good strike rate (that&amp;rsquo;s 1 in 7, if you&amp;rsquo;re too lazy to do the mental arithmetic). This is a teensy bit higher than the representation of University of Melbourne Philosophers in the Whole Wide World.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet here, lately.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;busy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;, getting stuff done.  I hope to be posting more soon, when various up-in-the-air things are more settled.  Still, here are some recent highlights which are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; was a blast.  It was very busy, but lots of fun was had: it was good to catch up with many folks I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen for ages including (&lt;a href=&#34;http://logica.rug.ac.be/~dirk/&#34;&gt;Diderik Batens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.uleth.ca/research/viewperson.html?uid=brown&#34;&gt;Bryson Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unica.it/~paoli/&#34;&gt;Francesco Paoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://olethhjortland.googlepages.com/home&#34;&gt;Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_jsel014&#34;&gt;Jerry Seligman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~grussell/&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;, who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in an all-too-long period of time) and to make the acquaintance of new folks (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/fberto&#34;&gt;Francesco Berto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.unc.edu/ripley.html&#34;&gt;David Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, Andreas Pietz, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogandnot-blog.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Burgis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_pgir999&#34;&gt;Patrick Girard&lt;/a&gt; and many others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been lots of fun to have Andi Pietz, Dave Ripley and Ole Hjortland hang out with us in Melbourne this semester.  I think they&amp;rsquo;re having fun, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun talking logic with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;Reasoning &amp;amp; Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; is my new level &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergraduate subject.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a class of 60, doing philosophy of probability, decision theory, etc., and we&amp;rsquo;re having a lot of fun.  Having students turn up to class, enthusiastic, despite 9am lectures, is something to behold.  Conrad Asmus is my tutor, and working with him makes things very easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/people/Conrad_Asmus/636311603&#34;&gt;Conrad Asmus&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; PhD student, has all-but-passed his PhD.  He has minor changes to make (which will be done within a few weeks, won&amp;rsquo;t they, Conrad?), and once they&amp;rsquo;re OKd by the local examiner, he&amp;rsquo;ll graduate. Congratulations, Conrad!  You&amp;rsquo;re my first beginning-to-end supervised graduate student, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have supervised your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Estonia in a week&amp;rsquo;s time, for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; it will be smaller, more focussed blast than WCP4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting back from Estonia, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at a &amp;lsquo;Men&amp;rsquo;s Breakfast&amp;rsquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://stjohnswestbrunswick.org.au/&#34;&gt;my church&lt;/a&gt;, under the gradiose title of &amp;lsquo;From Church to the Campus and Back Again: tales from a Christian teaching Philosophy at University.&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m under instruction to be funny, serious, profound, accessible and provocative &amp;ndash; in under 20 minutes.  I&amp;rsquo;ll see how I go&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year here, with reduced staffing numbers in Philosophy at Melbourne.  Everyone&amp;rsquo;s working Very Hard and doing Very Good Things, but until we get new positions and More People, things are going to be a struggle.  Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll have some better news soon, so we can advertise some jobs in the next few months.  Watch this space&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logical Pluralism, in Tartu</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Tartu in late August, for what looks like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;really fun conference&lt;/a&gt; on logical pluralism.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?speakers&#34;&gt;list of speakers&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily high-powered.  Having so many smart people talk about logical pluralism is exciting, and not a little bit scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in coming along, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?register&#34;&gt;let the organisers know by July 1&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the state of the art on logical pluralism, this conference is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de&#34;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mr30/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; for organising this.  It&amp;rsquo;s going to be my highlight of the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://informallogic.ca&#34;&gt;Informal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on argumentation theory and related issues, is now open access and online, after a 27 year history as a print (closed access) journal.    The editors have sent out a request for interested parties to subscribe.  Subscription is free: just &lt;a href=&#34;http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/user/register&#34;&gt;fill in this form on the site&lt;/a&gt;. The editors are aiming get enough subscribers to secure funding from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sshrc.ca&#34;&gt;SSHRC&lt;/a&gt; to keep the journal going now that they&amp;rsquo;re not taking paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a worthy goal: the more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;open access journals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://semprag.org&#34;&gt;the better&lt;/a&gt;!

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Alas, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/jobs-under-threat-at-melbourne-uni/2008/03/29/1206207499091.html&#34;&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; for not-very-good reasons.  Given the recent retirements in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Philosophy at Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, it would be worse than surprising if any of the new redundancies hit Philosophy.  However, the atmosphere around here not good &amp;ndash; what concerns us most is the scope for new hiring when the Faculty as a whole is in the red so much.  It is very hard to effectively plan ahead when so much is in flux and you&amp;rsquo;re not sure whether your efforts will benefit the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to find out more when we hear what the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/about/faculty/&#34;&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/about/seniorexec/davis.html&#34;&gt;Vice Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; has to say at a meeting of all Arts Faculty staff this Tuesday.  Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that they can articulate something that goes beyond slashing positions to rectify a budget hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to start posting on something so grim, but &amp;ldquo;trouble at t&amp;rsquo;mill&amp;rdquo; has been on our minds since mid-2007.  I hope to post more about more enjoyable things soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;. There are quite a few new items there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Are you an undergraduate student in philosophy, or do you know any undergraduate philosophy students?  If so, you might be interested in the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt; to be held from September 21 to 23.   This will be a chance for Australian and New Zealand undergraduate students who are interested in philosophy, to get together to talk philosophy with the faculty here at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that we have a broad range of interests, from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Ethics and Social Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic, this will be a fun weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for applying for a grant to come to the workshop is coming up very soon: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;August 15&lt;/strong&gt;.  For more details of how to be involved, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekend of September Friday 21 to Sunday 23,
Melbourne University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;School of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; will host the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne
Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt;, aimed at
third and fourth year students who intend to continue in any branch of academic
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday evening&lt;/em&gt; will begin with a Welcome Meeting followed by
dinner on Lygon Street, Carlton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Saturday&lt;/em&gt;, Melbourne faculty members will give presentations and/or lead seminars on a range of topics &amp;ndash; from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic. Saturday evening, another dinner on Lygon Street with more discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, each student will give a 15-or-so minute philosophy presentation, followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion. This will continue after lunch until, satiated, we disperse to downtown Melbourne or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten particularly talented 3rd year and Honours students from across Australasia will be invited. Their transportation expenses will be covered up to $400, with a possibility of greater funds for students from Western Australia and New Zealand. Melbourne Philosophy will provide college accommodation for three nights, September 21 through 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested students should submit a transcript, along with a letter discussing their philosophical interests and, if possible, an abstract of their presentation talk. A short letter of reference from a faculty member is also required. Deadline: &lt;strong&gt;15 August 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your material to Dr. Neil Thomason at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:neilt@unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;neilt@unimelb.edu.au&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk on the Philosopher&#39;s Zone</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on Logic in Australia at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/news-and-events/artsinaction07/program.php&#34;&gt;Monash University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Arts in Action&lt;/em&gt; festival&lt;/a&gt; in early June.  (This was a part of a long-running project on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/phil/research/history/grant8.html&#34;&gt;History of Australasian Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  The talk is now appearing, in two parts, on the (wonderful) ABC Radio National program, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/&#34;&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The first part was broadcast this weekend, but the audio can be downloaded from their &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2007/1992998.htm&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the next four weeks.  That was the first half of the talk, on possible worlds.  The second half, on paraconsistency, will be broadcast next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I made heavy use of digital projection.  I think you can follow the talk without it, but if you want to see the pretty pictures and diagrams, you can download the slides of the talk here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>... and we&#39;re back</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/05/_and_were_back/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2007 16:36:53 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/05/_and_were_back/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in Melbourne for a while.  The trip was very enjoyable, but I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to Melbourne with a chest bug, which has meant that I&amp;rsquo;m not quite up to full speed yet.  All non-essential activities (and alas, some essential ones, I fear) are progressing much more slowly than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;Logica 2007&lt;/a&gt; with so many great people, and then exploring Prague, catching up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, and getting to know more Czech logicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overdosing on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Medieval logic in Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and especially talking over Bradwardine with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring K&amp;oslash;benhavn with Christine and Zachary.  It was my second visit there, and Christine&amp;rsquo;s umpteenth, so it was a lot easier to get around given than we were more familiar with the place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating our way on the trains and buses from &amp;Aring;rhus to &lt;a href=&#34;http://legoland.dk&#34;&gt;Legoland in Billund&lt;/a&gt; with Zachary, and then enjoying all there was to see and do there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting everyone at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium in Wroc&amp;#322;aw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; and especially thinking through &amp;ndash; with Pavel Pudl&amp;aacute;k, Albert Visser, Alasdair Urquhart and Vedran &amp;#x10C;a&amp;#x10D;i&amp;#x107; &amp;ndash; a counterexample to a conjecture of Grzegorczyk&amp;rsquo;s.  The result of our thinking is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cas.cz/~pudlak/strings/doku.php?id=a_counterexample_to_a_conjecture_of_grzegorczyk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the thinking got done in a hike in the hills near Wroc&amp;#322;aw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flying back home with Z. Normally he finds the in-flight entertainment much more attractive than mundane activities such as sleep.  This can sometimes cause difficulty, especially when flying in to an airport for a quick change of planes, and we have a tired unhappy boy to navigate through the system.  This time, however, he slept well on both flights (Frankfurt to Singapore and Singapore to Melbourne), and we managed to get back home with very little jetlag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a good time was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back, even if we have to struggle through a bit more of winter here.  At least &lt;a href=&#34;http://lions.com.au&#34;&gt;our AFL team&lt;/a&gt; is performing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-pile-on-the-pressure-in-finals-bid/2007/08/04/1185648222098.html&#34;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-in-flagcontender-form-matthews/2007/07/30/1185647829342.html&#34;&gt;than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/rfmatchreport/pies-have-no-answers-against-roaring-lions/2007/07/28/1185339332180.html&#34;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;, so we might be able to cope with the end of the season here in football-mad Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in a sunny and summery Prague.  The locals tell me they it&amp;rsquo;s cooler than the unseasonably warm that it&amp;rsquo;s been in the last few years, but it seems nicely summery for one who has come from a winter.  I&amp;rsquo;m now chatting in the office with &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=801&#34;&gt;Timothy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jarda.peregrin.cz/welcome.htm&#34;&gt;Jarda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=798&#34;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/a&gt;, and monopolising Jarda&amp;rsquo;s computer while the others do work preparing for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/06/17/heading_off/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting in Gate 9 at the international terminal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne-airport.com.au/&#34;&gt;Melbourne Airport&lt;/a&gt;, getting ready to board my first flight on my trip to Europe.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a short hop &amp;ndash; Singapore/Frankfurt/Prague, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcdo.cz/&#34;&gt;very nice place&lt;/a&gt; for what to all appearances will be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;very enjoyable conference&lt;/a&gt;.  From then, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and then Denmark (K&amp;oslash;benhavn, and &amp;Aring;rhus) to meet up with Christine and Zachary, to have a little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legoland.dk&#34;&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt; while Christine does some work.  On the way out, it&amp;rsquo;s Wroc&amp;#322;aw, where I&amp;rsquo;ll play a little part in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;big conference&lt;/a&gt; before heading home with Zachary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, let me know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be around anywhere in the vicinity during this European trip.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be catching up with some mates, but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to meet more friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I owe you an email, that&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been ridiculously busy preparing for this trip, teaching courses, looking after the boy, etc&amp;hellip; But I&amp;rsquo;m ploughing through my backlog, and I might &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; get there in the next few weeks.  One can hope!)&lt;/p&gt;

What we mistakenly called &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; are actually &lt;em&gt;finials&lt;/em&gt;. (I&amp;rsquo;ve corrected the caption on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; in case you don&amp;rsquo;t understand what Christine meant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine took that photo on a finial-photographing expedition with Zachary and a friend from his class in school, on Zachary&amp;rsquo;s birthday a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2002/05/14/job_at_auckland/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, logic jobs in Philosophy Departments are pretty rare.  Well, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/04/logic-job-at-auckland-nz.html&#34;&gt;Richard mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s a logic job in Philosophy at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/departments/index.cfm?S=D_PHIL&#34;&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;.  A little bird has told me that even though the deadline is close (May 18), they&amp;rsquo;re keen to get the word out to get as many applicants as possible.  So, if you qualify (PhD or equivalent in philosophy, teaching experience, some research publications) then hop to it and apply.  The details are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vacancies.auckland.ac.nz/positiondetail.asp?p=5057&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Liveblogging talks was a bit beyond me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up with a few notes on the talks &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;here in Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  They&amp;rsquo;re not as extensive as my notes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/#commentbox&#34;&gt;Branden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_delia_graff_fara&#34;&gt;Delia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talks, but they&amp;rsquo;ll give you an idea of the fun we&amp;rsquo;ve been having here.  (After lunch today, there&amp;rsquo;s a batch of five talks, including mine.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write up comments on those, since before dinner I have to catch a shuttle to Calgary to catch a plane early tomorrow morning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the jump, comments on the talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-afternoon:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Monday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC Beall&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/glanzberg/home.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Glanzberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;Truth and Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this was a very nice talk, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there!  I misread the program, and thought it was at 3pm and not 2pm.  So, I missed out on it.  At least it gave JC a chance to make some jokes at my expense&amp;hellip;  I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to catch up, since I am &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; truth and paradoxes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://members.cox.net/wehmeier/&#34;&gt;Kai Wehmeier&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Identity is not a relation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai&amp;rsquo;s elegant talk was on Wittgensteinian predicate logic: logic in which distinct variables must denote distinct objects, and in which we do not have an identity predicate.  It seems well suited to introductory logic classes &amp;ndash; or at least, better suited to some untutored judgements about how to say things &amp;ndash; since to say &amp;ldquo;there are two &lt;em&gt;F*s&amp;rdquo; you simply say (&amp;#8707;*x&lt;/em&gt;)(&amp;#8707;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;Fx&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Fy&lt;/em&gt;), and we don&amp;rsquo;t require the usual (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8800; &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) conjunct.  Kai looked at how one might extend this logic to include names.  This is a tricky thing to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting material.  There are a number of different reasons one might want Wittgensteinian predicate logic: the metaphysical reason (identity just &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; a relation, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt;), and the linguistic data.  Kai thinks the metaphysical reason is the most interesting one.  That&amp;rsquo;s probably right.   I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; parallels with linguistic data will draw you further away from Wittgensteinian logic since it stays quite close to the syntax of classical predicate logic.  I think that the linguistic data is better modelled by including even more &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; features in the formal language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/&#34;&gt;Yiannis Moschovakis&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Synonymy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yiannis gave a clear talk looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/papers/lcmsfinal.pdf&#34;&gt;his development&lt;/a&gt; of the &amp;#955;-calculus with recursion clauses as model or account of &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt;, giving an account of synonymy.  The calculus is very elegant: it treats a &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as an &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; for determining a reference (an idea that is common in everyday explanations of the relationship between sense and reference).  One sweet feature of the calculus is that it can distinguish between synonymy or non-synonymy of different paradoxical senses, which have no reference.  The liar algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;~p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;) differs as an algorithm from the truth-teller algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;), even though neither have a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/people/~byi&#34;&gt;Byeong-Uk Yi&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Is Logic axiomatisable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byeong-Uk talked about compactness and the logic of plurals.  There were lots of examples of arguments that show that if we take plural constructions to be within the scope of logic (and surely, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be?), then we&amp;rsquo;ll have failures of compactness.  (Some arguments with infinitely many premies are not valid if we use any finite subset of those premises.)  The examples are good, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of them.   I think it will help if we have an idea of what logic is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, or other ways to demarcate the logical from the non-logical, to see the pros-and-cons of choices concerning compactness and non-compactness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-evening:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Monday evening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we had four wonderful short (15 minute!) talks by graduate students: Kate Manne (formerly of Melbourne, now at MIT), on supervaluations; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/&#34;&gt;Kenny Easwaran&lt;/a&gt; (Berkeley) on probability and dominance reasoning; Eleni Kalyvianaki (Athens) developing Yainnis&amp;rsquo; calculus for meaning, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~rurbania/&#34;&gt;Rafal Urbaniak&lt;/a&gt; (Calgary) on Lesniewski&amp;rsquo;s calculus.  All four were slick, elegant and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-morning:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Tuesday morning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/02/modality-morning.html&#34;&gt;Modality Morning&lt;/a&gt;.  First up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kracht.humnet.ucla.edu/marcus/index.html&#34;&gt;Marcus Kracht&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The certain past and possible future of modal logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a survey talk: the first part, on propositional modal logic, and the second part, on modal &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; logic.  Modal predicate logic is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of philosophical questions.  In the survey, Marcus looked at different options for giving semantics for modal predicate logic. Marcus mentioned the work of Shehtman &amp;amp; Skvortsov  on modal &amp;ldquo;metaframes&amp;rdquo;.  This was new to me.  These metaframes treat don&amp;rsquo;t contain a domain of &amp;lsquo;objects&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the quantifier is treated as another kind of context shift &amp;ndash; between different horizontal &amp;lsquo;slices&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the individual frames. This was interesting.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo&lt;/a&gt; and I had the same thought: another connection between quantifiers and modalities is that quantifiers themselves are &lt;em&gt;families&lt;/em&gt; of modal operators &amp;ndash; one for each variable.  In a frame semantics we should have points of evaluation, and the quantifiers and modalities each shift us around in the frame.  Different conditions give us different interactions between quantifiers and modalities.  It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to get a very general picture of how this works, and when the different accessibility conditions &amp;lsquo;factor out&amp;rsquo; into a domain of worlds and a domain of objects.  For more of Marcus&amp;rsquo;s line on this material, see his paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/counterparts.pdf&#34;&gt;Logically Possible Worlds and Counterpart Semantics for Modal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~okutz/&#34;&gt;Oliver Kutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/&#34;&gt;Steve Awodey&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/awodey.pdf&#34;&gt;Topological semantics for first-order modal logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (joint with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~kok6/&#34;&gt;Kohei Kishida&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very different talk.  It was not general, but highly specific: Steve presented a very elegant topological (sheaf) semantics for quanitfied S4.  The logic is not complete for the obvious frame semantics.  However, the sheaf semantics is completely natural and completely elegant.  There are &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; (the points in the space underlying the sheaf) and objects (the elements in the fibres), and the objects can generally vary from &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;world.&amp;rdquo;  The difference with standard frame semantics comes in the interpretation of the modality: in the natural models it is not intrepreted by an accessibility relation, but generally by a topological interior operator (as is well known in the interpretation of propositional S4 in topological spaces).  The heavy duty mathematics comes from the sheaf theory required to prove completeness.  The &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; is elegant.  I have not yet seen the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical work will come in the interpretation of these results. What does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  The exciting technical work comes in the extensions.  For what other systems do techniques like these work? I&amp;rsquo;d love to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-afternoon:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Tuesday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two talks in the afternoon were on &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0114/&#34;&gt;Volker Halbach&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Kripke-Feferman theory of truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volker explained how the internal and external logic of truth differ for the Kripke&amp;ndash;Feferman (KF) theory of truth.  It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; theory, but what it says about &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is not classical.  We have &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; ~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; as a theorem, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; T~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  One way to make them match up is to &lt;em&gt;weaken&lt;/em&gt; the external logic to be &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt;.  Volker showed that doing this would weaken the theory considerably.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a part of the paper, but this is an argument for his favoured theory of truth Friedman&amp;ndash;Sheard (FS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/jketland/&#34;&gt;Jeff Ketland&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Truth and Reflection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was on the structure of &lt;em&gt;deflationism&lt;/em&gt;, the view that truth is a purely formal notion and not a substantial one. (Whatever that means &amp;ndash; Jeff noted that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make these much more than slogans.)  One way to make this clearer is to focus on some precise issues.  Should adding a truth predicate be &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt; over a theory without the truth predicate (should it leave the ground-level theory &lt;em&gt;untouched&lt;/em&gt; meaning that you can&amp;rsquo;t prove anything new about the basic theory)?  Should it give you &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;?  That is, the addition of truth to a theory &lt;em&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; enable you to prove, relative to that theory, that every claim of that theory is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;?  This seems plausible &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a generalisation of the claim that if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (in the old theory) then T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Jeff rehearsed the argument why you can&amp;rsquo;t have both conservativity and reflection in general.  Why not?  Take a theory of arithmetic.  If we have reflection, then we can prove that the original theory is consistent (at least if the truth predicate behaves sensibly).  He went on to explain why you want &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this.  Reflection &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; reasonable, given that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; favourite (axiomatisable, consistent) theory of arithmetic &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re all incomplete &amp;ndash; would it be so bad to have a series of theories of arithmetic, of increasing strength, such that when we add a truth predicate to one of the theories in the series, you get another theory in the series.  Is this enough conservativity, and enough reflection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bris.ac.uk/philosophy/department/staff/hl.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;Applications of mathematics to philosophy: four case studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannes Leitgeb has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7813l8j5g324766/&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/j85373r152218p0m/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2731731994655g3/&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg628jx481l41785/&#34;&gt;tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.ndjfl/1012429715&#34;&gt;uth&lt;/a&gt;.  But he didn&amp;rsquo;t give talk about truth this time.  Instead we had very-elegant explanations of four (no, five! &amp;ndash; we had a free extra) different ways mathematics can be applied to philosophical problems. It was a great example of Hannes&amp;rsquo;s work.   As Alasdair Urquhart said in conversation, it was very &lt;em&gt;Carnapian&lt;/em&gt; in its optimism for how creative formal theorising can clarify philosophical issues.  It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; neat.  Go read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to get some idea of the many intresting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet more to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finished up the slides for my talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, the slides are available here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;Modal Models for Bradwardine&amp;rsquo;s Truth&lt;/a&gt; [1.3MB pdf]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a talk giving a modal logic interpretation for a medieval theory of truth due to Thomas Bradwardine, as it&amp;rsquo;s reconstructed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.  This will hopefully help out Steve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/medieval.html&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, by providing tools for exploring the strength of this kind of theory of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write up an extended paper version of this after getting comments from the audience.  Since the audience contains people who know a heck of a lot more than me about truth and about modal logic, I&amp;rsquo;m a little more on the anxious side than usual for such things.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff talk&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~graff/&#34;&gt;Delia Graff Fara&lt;/a&gt;, on &amp;ldquo;Relative identity and de re modality.&amp;rdquo;  She&amp;rsquo;s defending the thesis that material objects are identical to the matter of which they&amp;rsquo;re constituted.  For example, the statue Goliath (&lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;) is identical to the lump of clay Lumpel (&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;).  She wants to allow that &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while having &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; differing in their temporal and modal properties.  So, for example, in the future, a some more clay might become a part of the statue &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while not becoming a part of the lump of clay &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;. The original lump of clay is still present (and is joined by more clay), the original statue is still present, and is now &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt;.  You can see why this is desirable: after the addition of more clay, there&amp;rsquo;s still only one statue there, and the old statue did not disappear only to be replaced by a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delia wants to preserve the truth of claims that statues don&amp;rsquo;t have all their parts essentially, while portions of matter do have their parts essentially, while holding that statues are identical to portions of matter.  How can we do this?  I find this kind of work interesting, but deeply difficult.  Delia&amp;rsquo;s talk had a fair bit of relatively informal philosophy in it &amp;ndash; it was a discussion of counterpart relations and such critters &amp;ndash; and other participants followed the dialectic more closely than I did.  I always get confused by this kind of problem.  There are other talks at the workshop on quantified modal logic, which will hopefully give me some helpful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Branden Fitelson on Formal Epistemology</title>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The first talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt; is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org&#34;&gt;Branden Fitelson&lt;/a&gt;, who is giving a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Survey&amp;rdquo; of Formal Epistemology: some propaganda, and an example&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=formal+epistemology&#34;&gt;general movement&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/R/Wayne.D.Riggs-1/epistemology/index.html&#34;&gt;carving out&lt;/a&gt; the discipline of &amp;lsquo;formal epistemology&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a partly political talk, recounting the motivation for Formal Epistemology.  He recounted Bob Meyer&amp;rsquo;s manifesto of the &amp;ldquo;Logicians Liberation League.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s worth recounting the section Branden quoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be deceived, Establishment pigs (this means you too, Establishment dogs). The subservience of past generations of logicians does not mean that we shall bear forever our treatment as animals (you barnyard fowl). We are human beings (you swine). You are living in a day when logicians will not any longer endure your taunts, your slurs, your insults (you filthy vermin). In the name of A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell we gather; in the spirit of R. Carnap and A. Tarski, we march; by the word of W. V. O. Quine, we shall prevail. Beware you snakes of the Philosophical Power Structure, which you have created and which you maintain to put down the logician; you have caged the eagle of reason, the dove of wisdom, and the lark of a definite, precisely formulated formal system, with exact formation rules, a recursive set of axioms, and clear and cogent rules of inference, and you have made them your pigeons. Oh, you filterable viruses, we will shake you off and fly once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto was presented in 1969, but according to Branden it has relevance today: Branden sees &amp;ldquo;Formal Epistemology&amp;rdquo; as the application of formal techniques to broadly epistemological philosophical questions &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty broad.  Branden sees it as formal techniques applied to all areas of philosophy other than metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the talk cashed out a parallel between a &amp;ldquo;relevantist&amp;rdquo; argument against classical deductive logic and the Goodman &amp;ldquo;grue&amp;rdquo; argument against Carnapian inductive logic.  Branded argued that the friend of Carnapian inductive logic can make the same kind of response to the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of confirmation&amp;rdquo; that the friend of classical logic can against the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of entailment&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to distinguish entailment/consequence and the constraints on rational inference.  What do you need to do in the case of inductive logic?  It turns on the &lt;em&gt;Requirement of Total Evidence&lt;/em&gt;: that evidential support is always defined only in terms of the total evidence available to the agent in the situation. (I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the entire argument here: check &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;Branden&amp;rsquo;s slides&lt;/a&gt; for the details.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks right to me.  The interesting issue one has when one rejects a bridge principle like this (between entailment and rational infererence, or between evidential support and the totality of evidence available) is to give an alternative explanation of the tie between the two things thought to be connected by the bridge.  People thought the bridge principle was plausible for a reason.  Those of us (Gilbert Harman in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Change-View-Principles-Gilbert-Harman/dp/0262081555/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Change in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and JC and me in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Pluralism-J-C-Beall/dp/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) have to say something about the connection between deductive consequence and rational inference.  Similarly, Branden (and any defender of an inductive logic) should say something about what bridge principles are plausible and not suspect to these paradoxes.  Branden will be trying out some of these principles in his forthcoming book on inductive logic.&lt;/p&gt;

The program is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/workshops/2007/07w5060/Programme07w5060.pdf&#34;&gt;very full&lt;/a&gt;, and I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to report on &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; going on here.  (Heck, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even reported back from our time in India, despite &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/12/19/off_to_india/&#34;&gt;popular demand&lt;/a&gt;.)  So, please let me give my apologies in advance if youre talk doesn&amp;rsquo;t get reported here.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I was so interested in it I had to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; and not blog.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having too much fun and doing too much work lately to post anything here.  On the work side, our proposal to teach first-year logic in an interdisciplinary way as a &amp;ldquo;breadth&amp;rdquo; subject to all students in the &amp;ldquo;new generation&amp;rdquo; degrees from 2008, has passed the first hurdle.  We have a bucket of money to develop the course over the next year.  Lots of work, but lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fun side, we&amp;rsquo;ve been getting ready to go to India for our family holiday.  Landing in Mumbai, we go straight to Pune for Christmas with friends, and then we wend our way down the south-east coast on our way to Trivandrum. We&amp;rsquo;re off tomorrow, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be back in Melbourne on January 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My son, Z, asks me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, what is &lt;em&gt;Kantian freedom&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some time later&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, what is a &lt;em&gt;conceptual repertoire&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, he&amp;rsquo;s not a philosophical prodigy. He was curious about what I was reading, and I explained that I had an essay written by a student, and I had to figure out how good it was.  It happened to be an essay about John McDowell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Mind-World-John-McDowell/dp/0674576101/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Mind and World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, primarily on animal perception and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having a good conversation about whether or not &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/erasmus_christmas.jpg&#34;&gt;our cat, Erasmus&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; (Z thought &amp;lsquo;yes&amp;rsquo;, and I confessed being to being thoroughly confused on the matter after having read too many McDowell essays).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a McDowell expert, but I&amp;rsquo;m the second examiner, brushing up on my knowledge by reading a batch of honours essays. On the whole, they&amp;rsquo;ve been very good.  (Before this week I&amp;rsquo;d never seen a philosophy essay in the form of an &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/enoughrope&#34;&gt;extended interview with Andrew Denton&lt;/a&gt;.  &amp;ldquo;So, John, tell us how we can get off the seesaw between the Myth of the Given and the frictionless void&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, it&amp;rsquo;s my logic honours essays, and three honours theses.  Could be another long evening.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Horn tooting</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/11/15/horn_tooting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2006 11:36:20 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/11/15/horn_tooting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Two bits of horn tooting for today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, from the famous and notorious &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/&#34;&gt;Philosophical Gourmet Report&lt;/a&gt;. Brian Leiter &lt;a href=&#34;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2006/11/pgr_makes_the_n.html&#34;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the report &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20757575-14981,00.html&#34;&gt;hit the newspaper&lt;/a&gt; here in Australia.  The point of the little note in the Higher Education section of &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt; was that the ANU topped the rankings of Australian philosophy departments (as it has in the past), over Sydney and Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiously the article picks out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown.asp&#34;&gt;discipline specific areas&lt;/a&gt; where Melbourne scored higher than ANU (Applied Ethics) and where ANU scored higher (Metaphysics).  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised that Melbourne did well in Applied Ethics, since we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/cappe&#34;&gt;a centre&lt;/a&gt; devoted to it, and there are lots of good things going on in the field.  We ranked very well internationally in that area (we end up in the cohort of the top 7-18 departments in the survey).  What &lt;em&gt;The Australian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s report didn&amp;rsquo;t mention was that Melbourne also scored respectably well in Philosophical Logic. (Here, we&amp;rsquo;re in the cohort of the top 5-12.)  I suppose one salient difference is that in philosophical logic, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a named centre: we just a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#graham&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#allen&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#baz&#34;&gt;do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#greg&#34;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the second bit of shameless self-promotion concerning logic at Melbourne: You might have heard about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://growingesteem.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;process of institutional change&lt;/a&gt; taking place at &lt;a href=&#34;http://unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;this University&lt;/a&gt;.  One part of this is the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;http://melbournemodel.unimelb.edu.au/new_generation.html&#34;&gt;new undergraduate degrees&lt;/a&gt;.  One part of this is the development of new &amp;lsquo;breadth&amp;rsquo; subjects, to teach material to students across the university system: I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with colleagues on a proposal to teach a new first-year undergraduate unit &amp;ldquo;Logic: Language &amp;amp; Information,&amp;rdquo; collaboratively between &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;computer science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ee.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;electrical &amp;amp; electronic engineering&lt;/a&gt;.  The idea is that we teach propositional and predicate logic with lots of different applications in the related fields. It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a tricky process, but now that it&amp;rsquo;s all come together, the thing looks like it might fly.  With such interesting people here like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/Personnel/profile.php?PC_id=376&#34;&gt;Greg Hjorth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.ee.unimelb.edu.au/staff/davoren/&#34;&gt;Jen Davoren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~sb/&#34;&gt;Steven Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.unimelb.edu.au/about/staff/profiles/stirling/&#34;&gt;Lesley Stirling&lt;/a&gt;, we can teach a pretty good course on logic &amp;amp; language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Philosophical Poll: on a priori knowledge of possibilities</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/11/01/a_philosophical_poll_on_a_priori_knowledge_of_possibilities/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2006 16:56:32 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/11/01/a_philosophical_poll_on_a_priori_knowledge_of_possibilities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to guage some philosophical opinions.  (I don&amp;rsquo;t have many of my own.  Most of them have been worn down by &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;years of logical abuse&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some pre-requisites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s understand &amp;lsquo;possibly&amp;rsquo; as a &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; sort of possibility.  If it helps, think of it as truth in some possible world, no matter how outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s understand &lt;em&gt;a priori knowledge&lt;/em&gt; in the way that all of the people who talk about &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge understand the term.  Plausibly, we can&amp;rsquo;t know that Hesperus is Phosphorus &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;, but, plausibly, we can know the Chinese Remainder Theorem &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the question. Can we have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of any proposition of the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;possibly ~&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true?  (We don&amp;rsquo;t need to know &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true.)  Speaking rather briskly, do we have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge that fatalism is false? (Where &amp;lsquo;fatalism&amp;rsquo; is the thesis that everything that is true is metaphysically necessary.)  This is fudging a scope distinction, commuting a propositional quantifier under the knowledge operator, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much of a worry.  If you think that there&amp;rsquo;s a proposition &amp;lsquo;@&amp;rsquo; true in the actual world alone (of any of the possible worlds accessible from the actual world) then, the question reduces to this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we know &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; that possibly ~@?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think?  What do the &lt;em&gt;Standard Positions&lt;/em&gt; on these topics (&lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, necessity, semantics, etc.) say about this?   Is there anything that we obviously have &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of that clearly &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; entails possibly ~@?  (That&amp;rsquo;d be interesting: I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any examples right now&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person to have opinions on these sorts of issues, let me know what you think in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy: Question 2</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/09/16/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2006 13:30:54 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/09/16/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my (&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/19/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_1/index.php&#34;&gt;much delayed&lt;/a&gt;) answer to the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; of Vincent Hendricks and John Symons&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions about &lt;em&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-example-from-your-work-illustrates-the-role-formal-methods-can-play-in-philosophy:ad5560bbbdeb08138e666429c878e1b5&#34;&gt;What example from your work illustrates the role formal methods can play in philosophy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on one example from some of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years I have been working on topics in proof theory and connections between the way we can conceive of the structure of proofs and concerns in the theory of meaning.   The idea that the meaning of a word or a concept might be usefully explicated by giving an account of its inferential role is a common one &amp;ndash; the work of Ned Block, Bob Brandom and Michael Dummett are three very different examples of ways to take this idea seriously.  It is a truism that meaning has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; sort of connection with use, and use in reasoning and inference is a very important part of any account of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has seemed to me that if we are going to take take inferential role as playing its part in a theory of meaning, then we had better use the best available tools for giving an account of proof.  The theory of proofs should have something to teach philosophers who have interests in semantics.  This is not a mainstream position &amp;ndash; our vocabulary itself speeks against this, with the ready identification of model theory with &amp;lsquo;semantics&amp;rsquo; and proof theory with &amp;lsquo;syntax&amp;rsquo;. The work of intuitionists such as Dummett, Prawitz, Martin-L&amp;ouml;f and Tennant in conspicuous in its isolation at providing a contrary opinion to the mainstream.   This has led to the opinion that semantically anti-realist positions &amp;ndash; those that take proof or inference as the starting point of semantic theory, rather than truth-conditions or representation &amp;ndash; are naturally revisionary and intuitionist.  For intuitionistic logic has a clear motivation in terms of proof and verification, and it has seemed to many that orthodox classical logic does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a mistake.  It seems to me that natural proof-theoretic accounts of classical logic (starting with Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus, but also newer pieces of technology such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;proof-nets&lt;/a&gt;) can have a central place in a theory of meaning that starts with inferential role and not with truth.  We can think of the valid sequents (of the form &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; are sets of statements) as helping us &amp;lsquo;keep score&amp;rsquo; in dialectical positions.  The validity of the sequent &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; tells us that a position in dialogue in which each statement in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and each statement in &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is out of bounds according to the rules of &amp;lsquo;the game.&amp;rsquo;  In fact, the structural rules in the sequent calculus can be motivated in this way.  Identity sequents &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A2; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; tell us that asserting and denying &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (in the same context) is out of bounds.  The rule of weakening tells us that if asserting &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is out of bounds then adding an extra assertion or extra denial would not aid the matter.  The cut rule tells us that if a position in which &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is not out of bounds, then given a statement &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, either the addition as an assertion, or its addition as a denial will also not be out of bounds.  If asserting &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is out of bounds in a context, it is implicitly denied in that context.  Explicitly denying is no worse than implicitly denying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus in this way gives an alternative understanding of classical logic. We think of the rules for connectives as &amp;lsquo;definitions&amp;rsquo; governing assertions featuring the logical vocabulary.  Proof-theoretical techniques such as the eliminability of the &amp;lsquo;cut&amp;rsquo; rule tell us that these definitions are &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt;.  No matter what the rules of the game concerning our primitive vocabulary might be, we can add the classical logical connectives without disturbing the rules of assertion in that primitive vocabulary (the need for this point was made clearly in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~belnap&#34;&gt;Nuel Belnap&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/123029&#34;&gt;Tonk, Plonk and Plink&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;). The logical vocabulary allows us to &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Making-Explicit-Representing-Discursive-Commitment/dp/0674543300/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;make explicit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; what was merely &amp;lsquo;implicit&amp;rsquo; before.  The interpretation of the rules of the quantifiers &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/171450&#34;&gt;is particularly enlightening&lt;/a&gt;.  It allows us to sidestep the debate between &amp;lsquo;substitutional&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;objectual&amp;rsquo; accounts of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; I have tried to flesh out this picture, and to show how we can expand this story to take account of appropriate conditions for use for modal connectives such as possibility and necessity.  The key idea is that in modal discourse we not only assert and deny, but we make assertions and denials in different dialectical contexts, and an assertion of a necessity claim in one context can impinge on claims in other dialectical contexts.  This means that we can give a semantics of modal vocabulary that motivates a well-known modal logic (in the first instance, the simple modal logic S5, but the extension to other logics is not difficult) in which possible worlds are not the starting point of semantic explanation.  Modal vocabulary needs not be conceived of as a way of describing possible worlds.  It can be understood as a governing discourse in which we not only assert and deny to express our own commitments, but also to articulate the connections between our concepts.  The structures of dialectical positions need not merely contain assertions and denials, but these may be partitioned into different &amp;lsquo;zones&amp;rsquo; according to structure of the different suppositions and shifts of context in that discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An idea...</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I just had an &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt; today. From here, it seems like a &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Neat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Idea&lt;/em&gt;.  (Having the idea made me remember what it feels like to prove something you&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with for a long time: a mix of excitement, wonder, awe, relief, and much else besides. It&amp;rsquo;s welcome to be reminded of why I like working in logic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea isn&amp;rsquo;t a new theorem, but what seems to me to be a simpler proof of an already proved theorem.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try writing it up in the next couple of days and I&amp;rsquo;ll report back.  It could dissolve into dust and vapour, but if it survives the writeup process, I&amp;rsquo;ll be one happy logician.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t survive, at least I&amp;rsquo;ll have learned something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week we had a couple of logic seminars from neat west-coast of the USA types: &lt;a href=&#34;https://webfiles.berkeley.edu:443/titelbaum/home.htm&#34;&gt;Mike Titelbaum&lt;/a&gt; from Berkeley and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~peters/&#34;&gt;Stanley Peters&lt;/a&gt; from Stanford.  At drinks after the logic seminar I met &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/~steedman/&#34;&gt;Mark Steedman&lt;/a&gt; from Edinburgh, and it was nice to have a symmetric reaction &amp;ldquo;oh, you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; for &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; in {&amp;lsquo;MS&amp;rsquo;,&amp;lsquo;GR&amp;rsquo;}.  He was able to fill me in on the very interesting work done on substructrual logics, categorial grammar, and statistical parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ten Questions about Books</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/29/ten_questions_about_books/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2006 22:02:48 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/29/ten_questions_about_books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcrankers.blogspot.com/2006/07/book-meme.html&#34;&gt;Jo asked so nicely&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll add my answers to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2006/07/one-book-meme.html&#34;&gt;one book meme&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s going around the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that changed your life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Roberts, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802819397/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Spirituality and Human Emotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s because of this book that I&amp;rsquo;m a philosopher, believe it or not.  Reading it, I saw that the philosophy needn&amp;rsquo;t be self-contained, but could be used to say something productive and interesting about matters of human concern.  In my undergraduate years I spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time reading theology, and I learned most from the literature that was philosohpical in technique and in style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;ve read more than once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. S. Lewis, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064471071/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My out-and-out favourite of the Narnia Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;d want on a desert island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gospel according to John&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Following Jo&#39;s example, I&#39;ll treat different biblical books as different books.  For me it&#39;s a toss-up for different gospels, but John&#39;s the one I&#39;m least &#39;at home&#39; with and I think it bears repeated readings, as is fitting on a desert island.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that made you laugh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanislaw Lem, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0156027593/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Cyberiad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an intellectual laugh mostly, rather than slapstick, but there are laughs on each page of these wise, knowing, sensitive tales of the robot constructors Trurl and Klaupacius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book that made you cry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Mitchell, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375507256/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Cloud Atlas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A truly vertiginous read: six interlocking stories from the 1850s, through the present, to the near future and after the collapse of civilisation.  Deeply moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;One&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Two&lt;/ins&gt; book&lt;ins&gt;s&lt;/ins&gt; you wish had been written&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Routley, &lt;em&gt;Exploring Meinong&amp;rsquo;s Jungle &amp;amp; Beyond, &lt;ins&gt;the edited version&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0685056368/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;existing version&lt;/a&gt; version is an amazing read, but with a good &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; it could have changed the face of philosophy in this country.  In a very good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Anderson, Nuel Belnap, J. Michael Dunn &lt;ins&gt;and Robert K. Meyer&lt;/ins&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Entailment, Volume 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691073392/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;existing &lt;em&gt;Entailment, Vol 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very good, but the version that was foreshadowed in the first volume of &lt;em&gt;Entailment&lt;/em&gt; would have been fantastic.  But that would have required the continuing of the Belnap/Meyer collaboration, which broke down in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you wish had never been written&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to answer this question, so I&amp;rsquo;ll interpret it differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Marr and Marian Wilkinson, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1741144477/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Dark Victory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unutterably sad that this book &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be written.  I wish that it had been impossible to write because the events had never taken place.  Instead, we&amp;rsquo;ve got to make sure that they never happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD James, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446364622/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a thing for well-written dystopias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One book you&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to read&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Tudge,  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0141009500/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;So Shall we Reap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; I started reading this before the sabbatical last year, and I didn&#39;t take it with me -- it&#39;s still lying in my pile of things to read.  It&#39;s got a wonderful subtitle: &amp;quot;How Everyone Who Is Liable to Be Born in the Next Ten Thousand Years Could Eat Very Well Indeed; and Why, in Practice, Our Immediate Descendants Are Likely to Be in Serious Trouble&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tag five people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this and want to do write your own answers, consider yourself tagged.  Answer the questions on your own blog and link here in the comments, or answer in the comments for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>On the Interview</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/22/on_the_interview/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2006 19:24:00 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/22/on_the_interview/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/&#34;&gt;the interview&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it went.  The ABC team did a good job with the editing (I think the interview I recorded was a bit over 30 minutes).  I never thought that I&amp;rsquo;d live to hear the day that someone explained the semantics of first degree entailment on national radio, and I was especially grateful that my little plug for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sylvan&#34;&gt;Richard Sylvan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/&#34;&gt;Bob Meyer&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t end up on the cutting-room floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your edification, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm&#34;&gt;transcript is of the interview here&lt;/a&gt; and the audio is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/feeds/pze_20060722.mp3&#34;&gt;MP3 file available for the next four weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  You can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/&#34;&gt;subscribe to a podcast&lt;/a&gt; of the program if you like to hear this kind of thing more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re visiting my website on following the link from the Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone page and you want to know more about logic, there are a few things you could do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download my little introductory article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logic_chapter/&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in a nice volume called the &lt;em&gt;Fundamentals of Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; edited by John Shand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My textbook, also imaginatively entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/logic/&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an introduction to the subject, geared to philosophy students.  You can order it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in &lt;em&gt;pluralism&lt;/em&gt; about logic, the topic I ended my discussion with Alan on, then you&amp;rsquo;ll want to have a look at my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; co-authored with my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC Beall&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Connecticut.  You can get this book from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>On Politics</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the car this evening, Z (our five-and-a-bit year-old son) says, unprompted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reply &amp;ldquo;yes &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; why does Kim Beazely want to be Prime Minister?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that he&amp;rsquo;s keeping up with his world. It&amp;rsquo;s telling that we found it difficult to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interviewed again</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2006 14:58:15 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/18/interviewed_again/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I trooped down to the ABC Melbourne studios in Southbank, to sit in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://imaginingaustralia.blogs.com/photos/launch/andrewpetetardisbooth.html&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tardis&amp;rsquo; booth&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/about/default.htm#presenter&#34;&gt;Alan Saunders of &lt;em&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on logic, the liar paradox and other stuff I think about.  Alan was feeling unwell and suffering from a croaky voice, so the interview that goes to air might be more of a monologue than what took place in the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it was good fun to do the interview: Alan&amp;rsquo;s a good interviewer and he knows his stuff. Tune in or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1689459.htm&#34;&gt;download the interview&lt;/a&gt; once it airs on July 22.  (The ABC keeps these program files online for a month.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, like me, are interested in this kind of radio program, you can always &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/subscribe/default.htm#podcasting&#34;&gt;subscribe to the podcast&lt;/a&gt; to get the latest program when it is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month I was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/06/06/interviewed/&#34;&gt;interviewed for &lt;em&gt;The Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this month, it&amp;rsquo;s radio.  What is coming next?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assorted Observations</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/07/assorted_observations/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2006 23:23:59 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/07/07/assorted_observations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to get back into the swing of work, but I&amp;rsquo;m slowly clawing my way through.  Jetlag has been &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse on my return than on the European end of the trip.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also been concentrating on my parental duties, as my Significant Other is taking her conference trip. Playing with your son is much more fun than doing niggly administrative tasks.  If you&amp;rsquo;re awaiting an email reply from me, it should be coming in the next few days. The delay is nothing personal &amp;ndash; the queue is rather long right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The promised observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you speak to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/about/default.htm#presenter&#34;&gt;radio presenter&lt;/a&gt; on the telephone, it sounds eerily like you are talking to a radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you buy your coffee on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pb.unimelb.edu.au/CampusMaps/Parkville.pdf&#34;&gt;campus&lt;/a&gt;, pricing varies from place-to-place.   Now, despite the fact that &lt;em&gt;Plush Fish&lt;/em&gt; (the sushi place), &lt;em&gt;Chill Out&lt;/em&gt; (the rice paper rolls and juice place) and &lt;em&gt;Caf&amp;eacute; Suave&lt;/em&gt; (the place in the commerce courtyard, near the Ballieu Library) are run by the same people, the price you pay &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; for your fairtrade coffee differs from place to-place.  This week I have paid a 30 cent premium for faitrade at Plush Fish and Chill Out but only 10 cents at Caf&amp;eacute; Suave.  This could be either a subtle marketing exercise (their selling fairtrade coffee is a recent innovation) or an error in the programming of their cash registers, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on fairtrade coffee on campus, check &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hooked.org.au/mu&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pricing for the fairtrade coffee is on top of the base of $3.10 price for my medium skim milk flat white with no sugar. It is a mouthful to order, saying &amp;lsquo;a medium skim milk fairtrade flat white with no sugar, please&amp;rsquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s the way of the world.  At least I don&amp;rsquo;t order &lt;em&gt;decaf&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes ordering coffee as complex as ordering a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/fares_zones/&#34;&gt;metcard&lt;/a&gt;. Try remembering a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/fares_zones/10xtwo_hour.php&#34;&gt;10 trip, 2 hour, zone 1, full fare metcard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; each time you need one.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never managed to get it right.  Today I asked for a &amp;lsquo;2 trip, 10 hour, zone 1, full fare metcard&amp;rsquo; which would not be the same thing at all.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had some long tram journeys, but none have been 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should order my metcards over the &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metcard/store/&#34;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;.  (They promise to mail them to you for free.)  That way I&amp;rsquo;d not have to embarrass myself in front of a flesh-and-blood human being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in Melbourne, after my whirlwind jaunt in Nancy.  I was in too much of a rush on Day 4 of the conference to post thoughts on Day 3 or Day 4.  I promise I&amp;rsquo;ll do that once I recover from my jetlag and deal with my growing pile of mail, both snail and electronic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the nicest thing about reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/adventures-in-blog-land/2006/07/01/1151174437503.html?page=fullpage&#34;&gt;this article on blogging in this morning&amp;rsquo;s newspaper&lt;/a&gt; was hearing Z&amp;rsquo;s laugh when he recognised that a picture of me was in the newspaper. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s you, Dad!&amp;rdquo; he chortled when he recognised me.&lt;/p&gt;

Talks were scheduled in the morning leaving the afternoon free.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/lynch/lynch.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Lynch&lt;/a&gt; and I took in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.culture.fr/PublicItems/musees/5439506&#34;&gt;Mus&amp;eacute;e des Beaux-Arts&lt;/a&gt; and talked philosophy and much else with &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/&#34;&gt;Peter van Inwagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/SS/index.htm&#34;&gt;Scott Shalkowski&lt;/a&gt; and others into the evening and late in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning featured a well-put-together talk by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/?username=dfl0ejl&#34;&gt;Jonathan Lowe&lt;/a&gt; on the contrast between his robust essentialism and conceptualism.  For Jonathan, conceptualism collapses into a global anti-realism because it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; requires a kind of essentialism about concepts and agents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attended a helpful presentation by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/philuqam/dept/page_perso.php?id=32&#34;&gt;Mathieu Marion&lt;/a&gt; on game semantics for logic.  (For an introduction to game semantics, try the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-games/&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia entry&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~wilfrid/&#34;&gt;Wilfrid Hodges&lt;/a&gt;.) Mathieu contrasted the agonistic conception of game semantics according to which the two players (proponent and opponent, or Abelard and Eloise) are competing against one another.  He proposed a cooperative understanding in which the players are building something together, like a proof.  This strikes me as plausible.  The devil, however, is in the detail.  The distinctive feature of game semantics is that the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; is not a play of a game, or something you can look back on as having constructed.  A proof corresponds to a winning strategy for the proponent, and a refutation corresponds to a winning strategy for the opponent.  (&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark&lt;/em&gt;: Compare this to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/06/13/key_ideas_in_the_theory_of_proofs_1_the_duality_of_proofs_and_counterexamples&#34;&gt;my comments a few weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; on the duality between proofs and counterexamples.  Game semantics is an account of proofs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; counterexamples.  It seems to be interestingly self-dual.  I should think more about this&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;End parenthetical remark&lt;/em&gt;.)  The issue I find with thinking of game semantics as a cooperative construction of a proof or a refutation is that you don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; a proof or refutation through a play of the game.  You construct a proof (or a refutation) through repeated plays of the game where the opponent (or proponent) tries all possible options and the proponent (or opponent) deals with them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will bear more thinking, and I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to do some of that thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now however, I&amp;rsquo;ll attend to Day 3.  The report on Day 3 will hopefully come today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m conference blogging here in Nancy at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/colloques/AR06/eindex.htm&#34;&gt;Realism/Anti-Realism conference&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s been neet, chatching up with people &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nd.edu/~ndphilo/faculty/pva.htm&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/rub.php?lng=en&amp;amp;cat=_insti&amp;amp;rub=r04&amp;amp;srub=01&amp;amp;ssrub=10&amp;amp;m2rub=0&#34;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/SS/index.htm&#34;&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~logik/wansing/wansing.html&#34;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.filosofie.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=39&amp;amp;c=36&#34;&gt;while&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, after a not-completely-rested-night as I tried to sleep through a rather rowdy French community beeping car horns after their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&amp;amp;cid=72781&#34;&gt;3-1 victory in the round of 16&lt;/a&gt;, I went to five talks.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the quick run-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/rub.php?lng=en&amp;amp;cat=_insti&amp;amp;rub=r03&amp;amp;srub=01&amp;amp;ssrub=12&amp;amp;sssrub=01&amp;amp;m2rub=2&#34;&gt;Jacques Dubucs&lt;/a&gt; talked about his &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; antirealism, according to which &lt;em&gt;feasible&lt;/em&gt; computable functions should play a role in meaning theory rather than the computable functions of more traditional constructive logic.  Dubucs and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.er.uqam.ca/nobel/philuqam/dept/page_perso.php?id=32&#34;&gt;Mathieu Marion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stl.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/sitespersonnels/rahman/accueilrahman.html&#34;&gt;Shahid Rahman&lt;/a&gt; are interested in the application of substructural logics (and game semantics) to these matters, and I should have a look at this more.  There are interesting connections between feasibility and structural rules, worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsci.lsu.edu/phil/phil1/cogburn/index.html&#34;&gt;John Cogburn&lt;/a&gt; gave a nice paper on Moore&amp;rsquo;s paradox for anti-realists.  The Moorean inference is the step from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;ldquo;I believe that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  This inference is clearly wrong, but on semantically anti-realist lights (at least, for those kinds of constructivists for whom an argument is valid if warrant for the premises can be converted into warrant for the conclusion) then it seems valid enough.  If I have warrant for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then this warrant is the kind of thing that convinces me that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ll believe it.  John pointed out that even for a constructivist, the fact that I can find no particular counterexample to the Moore inference (some proposition such that I assert it but deny that I believe it) it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it valid in the general sense: since for validity, we need the inference to work in any context, and the Moore inference clearly doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  If we suppose that there are truths that I don&amp;rsquo;t believe.  Call one of them, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. From &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; we can&amp;rsquo;t infer &lt;em&gt;Bp&lt;/em&gt;.  We can allow the inference from a statement that we&amp;rsquo;ve asserted to the fact that we believe it, but it&amp;rsquo;s another move to say that this inference under hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt;, giving my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/antirealist&#34;&gt;anti/realism paper&lt;/a&gt;.  Not the best presentation of a paper I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done, but I got some good comments on the paper.  Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently/writing/antirealism&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and give me some comments of your own if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lucamoretti.org/&#34;&gt;Luca Moretti&lt;/a&gt; (I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that he was in Sydney at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usyd.edu.au/time&#34;&gt;Centre for Time&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a long way to go to find out that someone is at the other end of the Hume Highway from me) gave a talk about minimalism about truth and whether it&amp;rsquo;s neutral between realism and anti-realism.  Luca pointed out that on Wright&amp;rsquo;s kind of pluralism, we can apply the minimalist &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; principle to the claim that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; (for some choice of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; in mind: Luca chose &amp;ldquo;snow is white&amp;rdquo;, I think).  It&amp;rsquo;s true that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; iff if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, and this biconditional is true necessarily.  (Wright&amp;rsquo;s minimalism is about the &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; biconditional for propositions.)  Now, since it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, we can infer that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that (it&amp;rsquo;s true that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;).  But this has the form &amp;ldquo;necessarily &lt;em&gt;Fa&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (as the claim of truth is a predication of truth to a proposition), and so, we can infer that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; exists.  Here &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is the proposition that if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;: this proposition exists necessarily.  This kind of minimialism, allegedly neutral between kinds of realism and anti-realism seems to conclude a kind of realism about propositions.  Sorting out the options here seems quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/lynch/lynch.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Lynch&lt;/a&gt; gave a paper about pluralism about truth, and distinguishing role functionalism about truth from other kinds of pluralism about truth.  The motivating idea is that there are different ways that things can be true: correspondence, coherence, etc., describe different ways that things can be true, and different kinds of things can be true in different ways.  Lynch argued that you can make sense of this kind of intuition if you are happy to say that there&amp;rsquo;s an overarching &lt;em&gt;role&lt;/em&gt; that truth can play and that there are different realisers to this role.  I think that there&amp;rsquo;s something quite interesting in this, however, I&amp;rsquo;m hampered by my lack of a clear understanding when people confidently individuate properties&amp;hellip; (this is common in all discussions of the role/realiser distinction, and I see people having confident intuitions of one property (say pain) realised by another property (brain state)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More blogging later if the wireless is still working. Now I&amp;rsquo;m off to drinks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Key Ideas in the theory of proofs #1: The Duality of Proofs and Counterexamples</title>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/06/13/key_ideas_in_the_theory_of_proofs_1_the_duality_of_proofs_and_counterexamples/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now that my undergraduate teaching is done for the semester, I can devote more time to research.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this place to post some material from my proof theory project.  My goal is to present some key ideas in an accessible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s idea is the duality between &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proofs&lt;/em&gt;: You can think of a valid argument as underwritten by a &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.  A proof leads from the premises to the conclusions, and shows how the conclusions follow from the premises.  An invalid argument from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to conclusions &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is one for which there is no proof leading from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different theories of proofs will characterise these in different ways (natural deduction, Hilbert-style axiom systems, Gentzen-style sequent systems, tableaux, etc.) but at heart, a proof is a formal structure that bears witness to a valid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;: You can think of an invalid argument as witnessed by a &lt;em&gt;counterexample&lt;/em&gt;.  A counterexample is a way of making the premises true and the conclusions untrue, and it shows how the conclusions say something &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than what is present in the premises.  A valid argument from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to conclusions &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; is one for which there is no counterexample rendering &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; true and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different theories of counterexamples (call them &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;interpretations&lt;/em&gt; if you like) characterise them in different ways: truth tables, many-valued algebras, models with domains of quantification or &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; models for intensional logics, but at its heart, a counterexample bears witness to an invalid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the duality: Proofs witness &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; and counterexamples witness &lt;em&gt;invalidity&lt;/em&gt;.  A proof gives you a &lt;em&gt;validity&lt;/em&gt; fact.  Only an &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of proofs tells you about invalidity.   Conversely, a counterexample gives you an &lt;em&gt;invalidity&lt;/em&gt; fact.  Only an &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of counterexamples tells you about validity.  These two different ways of characterising logical consequence have very very different properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many key results in 20th Century logic, such as G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s completeness theorem, pair together these two notions.  A &lt;em&gt;soundness&lt;/em&gt; result (for a proof system, given some set of counterexamples) tells you that a proof system provides a proof from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;only when&lt;/em&gt; the argument from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; has no counterexample.  A &lt;em&gt;completeness&lt;/em&gt; proof (for a proof system, given some set of counterexamples) tells us that a proof system provides a proof from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;whenever&lt;/em&gt; the argument from &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; has no counterexample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a well-matched pair of a system of proofs and a system of counterexamples &amp;ndash; for a notion of logical consequence &amp;ndash; then you have two different ways to look at the one relation between premises and conclusions.  These different tools are useful for different purposes.  If you use just one of them, you might be selling yourself short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Aside&lt;/em&gt;: This was my critical point in my essay &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/facts/&#34;&gt;One Way to Face Facts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;: I found Stephen Neale&amp;rsquo;s excellent little book on slingshot arguments &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0199247153/consequentlyorg?v=glance&#34;&gt;Facing Facts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) helpful, but one-sided.  In the book, we find detailed analysis of different slingshot &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  Neale charts which principles combine together to produce unwanted results.  What makes the work one-sided is that he never walks on the other side of the street to look at &lt;em&gt;counterexamples&lt;/em&gt;.  (He never looks at models to show that particular combinations of premises &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; produce the unwarranted conclusions on their own, as you can easily do if you produce counterexamples.)  It is as if he is charting a boundary between territories by making occasional forays from &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; side of the boundary, never realising that you can jump the fence to see it from the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; side as well. &lt;em&gt;End of the aside&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we have two different sorts of tools for characterising valid argument, a philosopher is constitutionally bound to ask a question: Is one of these tools more &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; than the other?  Many would say &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;.  My colleague &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/gp.html&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt; takes counterexamples to be primary, and proofs to only be a means for enumerating the notion of logical consequence given by means of the counterexamples. (See, for example, his paper &amp;ldquo;Validity&amp;rdquo; in Varzi&amp;rsquo;s volume &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/site/157586178X.html&#34;&gt;The Nature of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.)  Others, like Dummett&amp;rsquo;s semantic anti-realist or Brandom&amp;rsquo;s inferentialist, would seem to take proof as primary, as you explain the meanings of a concept by articulating its role in &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do we have to choose?  Why think that one way of characterising logical consequence is any &amp;ldquo;deeper&amp;rdquo; than the other? To put things in an more cryptic manner: why think that there is just one direction of &amp;ldquo;depth&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;priority&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I was interviewed by Lisa Mitchell from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au&#34;&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt; about academic blogging.  She&amp;rsquo;s writing an article for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.education.theage.com.au/inpaper.asp&#34;&gt;education supplement&lt;/a&gt; (published on Mondays).  It&amp;rsquo;s a piece with a long lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I&amp;rsquo;ll recognise anything I said in the article, and if she&amp;rsquo;ll quote me.  (I blabbed on for 25 minutes.  I hope there was some useful raw material there &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve finished lectures for the semester, and I&amp;rsquo;m officially &lt;em&gt;recovering&lt;/em&gt;.  It was fun teaching &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;, but it was also a hard slog.  Next semester I have a light teaching load, with my honours logic seminar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight last week was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2006/05/on-road-again.html&#34;&gt;Richard Zach&amp;rsquo;s visit&lt;/a&gt;.  He gave two nice talks.  One on vagueness and logic &amp;ndash; setting out different options for logic and semantics in the light of vagueness &amp;ndash; and the other, on the epsilon calculus.  (How Richard managed to get through the content of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/papers/etheorem.pdf&#34;&gt;his big paper with Georg Moser&lt;/a&gt; in an hour with each of us following everything, I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; idea, but he did.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have to slog through some marking, and some writing.  This weekend, however, I&amp;rsquo;m in Adelaide for a little ``logic axis&amp;rdquo; meeting.  I&amp;rsquo;ll give a talk on fixing up Prawitz&amp;rsquo;s proof theory for the positive fragment of the relevant logic R.  I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the written version of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Regret and Slingshots</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a silly puzzle for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regret seems like a factive emotion.  You can&amp;rsquo;t truly regret that you forgot to feed the cat today if, indeed, you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; feed the cat.  If you did feed the cat and you forgot that you did, then it seems to you like you&amp;rsquo;re regretting not feeding the cat, but you&amp;rsquo;re as mistaken about your regret as you are about feeding the cat.  You think you didn&amp;rsquo;t feed the cat and you&amp;rsquo;re sorry that you didn&amp;rsquo;t, but that&amp;rsquo;s not regret.  Or so some people think, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose that regret is factive like that.  Then it&amp;rsquo;s plausible to think that the circumstance you&amp;rsquo;re regretting is in some way a &amp;lsquo;component&amp;rsquo; of that regretting.  (On this view, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s factive: if the circumstance of my not-feeding-the-cat isn&amp;rsquo;t there, then I can&amp;rsquo;t be related to that circumstance in &amp;ldquo;regretful&amp;rdquo; manner.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the case, then it&amp;rsquo;s plausible to think that disjunctive regrets are a strange sort of thing.  Regretting that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; might be a relationship to a situation in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true (when it&amp;rsquo;s the truth of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; that makes the disjunction true) or one in which &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true (the other case).  A regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; might be the same kind of thing as a regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; (if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is the case) or a regret that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that in general, a disjunctive regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; since it is a regretting relationship to a circumstance in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true &amp;ndash; brings with it a regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or a regret that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, since either the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-or-&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; circumstance is one in which &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true, or it&amp;rsquo;s one in which &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true.  Call this the &lt;em&gt;disjunction&lt;/em&gt; principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it seems that regretting that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) and regretting that (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) are no different to one another.  Similarly, regretting that (it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)) is no different to regretting that (either it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or it&amp;rsquo;s not the case that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) and so on.  It seems a little bit plausible that if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are two statements that are &lt;em&gt;logically equivalent&lt;/em&gt; then regret that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and regret that &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t differ.   Call this the &lt;em&gt;equivalence&lt;/em&gt; prinicple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, suppose that the classical story of logical equivalence, that you were taught when you were taught truth tables, is correct.  This is enough to get the puzzle going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things can&amp;rsquo;t all be right.  Unless you have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; on your mind.  Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  Then, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is logically equivalent to (either (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)).  So, your regret that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; means that you also regret that (either (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;)), by the &lt;em&gt;equivalence prinicple&lt;/em&gt;. By the &lt;em&gt;disjunction principle&lt;/em&gt;, you either regret (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) or you regret (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Suppose, without loss of generality, that it&amp;rsquo;s (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Now (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) is equivalent to ((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) or (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  So by the &lt;em&gt;eqiuvalence principle&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip;  You see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a version of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=slingshot+argument&#34;&gt;slingshot argument&lt;/a&gt; for regrets.  Clearly, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t believe the equivalence thesis (in its classical guise, at least) and the disjunction thesis for regrets.  I&amp;rsquo;ve argued &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ten&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;favour&lt;/em&gt; of the disjunction thesis and &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; classical equivalence for &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ten&#34;&gt;truthmakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should we think in this case?  Are either of the equivalence or the disjunction theses plausible?  I&amp;rsquo;ve got my own ideas but I&amp;rsquo;ve written enough for one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to Robert Anderson for getting me thinking about regrets and disjunctions and proposing something like the disjunction thesis.  He thought of it when worrying about bets and regrets and Lloyd Humberstone&amp;rsquo;s puzzle &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/20/on_the_cable_guy_paradox/&#34;&gt;mentioned in the previous post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the Cable Guy Paradox</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/04/20/on_the_cable_guy_paradox/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Have you ever waited for a tradesperson to come to your place? &lt;a href=&#34;http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/people-defaults/alanh/index.php3&#34;&gt;Alan H&amp;aacute;jek&lt;/a&gt; uses this example in an article entitled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/591815&#34;&gt;The Cable Guy Paradox&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  The issue is straightforward.  You and I are waiting for the cable guy who has given you a window between 8am and 4pm for his arrival.  He will arrive &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; 8am, and &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; 4pm.  We while away our time with a bet.  Before 8am, we bet on whether he&amp;rsquo;ll come in the morning or the afternoon.  It seems that there&amp;rsquo;s no reason to choose between the interval (8am,12noon) and (12noon,4pm).  (Let&amp;rsquo;s assume, with H&amp;aacute;jek that it&amp;rsquo;s probability zero that the moment of arrival is 12noon &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;.)  It&amp;rsquo;s equally likely that he arrive in the morning and in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there seems to be an asymmetry.  H&amp;aacute;jek cites the &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you now have a choice between two options. You should not choose one of these options if you are certain that a rational future self of yours will prefer that you had chosen the other one &amp;ndash; unless both your options have this property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H&amp;aacute;jek seems that using this principle, we should bet on the &lt;em&gt;afternoon&lt;/em&gt; and not the &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt;, since whenever the cable guy arrives, it will be &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; 8am (we specified that in the setup of the problem), so the will be some interval of time (8 am, 8+&amp;#x03B5; am) during which I will take the probability of the &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt; arrival to be something smaller than the probability of the &lt;em&gt;afternoon&lt;/em&gt; arrival, and I will regret my choice for the bet if I had chosen morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the paper, H&amp;aacute;jek uses this example to motivate a rejection and revision of the &lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;.  I think that rejecting this principle seems sound, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this example shows it.  Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that in this case I am &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; to be frustrated.  For I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that there is, in fact, an interval of time where I will regret making the bet.  First, the bet might be cancelled for some reason &amp;ndash; the guy might arrive &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt;, contrary to his promise.  More interestingly, we might decide to go out and leave someone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; to mind the house, only to return after 4pm.  In that case, at any time after 8am, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that the guy hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have the same grounds for regret.  So, I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll have my regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite example, however, is this one: I don&amp;rsquo;t know that you won&amp;rsquo;t mug me, put me in the cupboard and mind the house without my company.  Furthermore, you might record the front door with your camera, and then, after 4pm, let me out, and play the recording &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt;.  In that case, there&amp;rsquo;s some interval of time in which I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; having chosen the morning rather than the afternoon, by completely symmetric reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t see how I can be &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll be frustrated with my &lt;em&gt;morning&lt;/em&gt; bet in the sense required by H&amp;aacute;jek.  (He&amp;rsquo;s very careful to distinguish certain frustration from &lt;em&gt;very likely&lt;/em&gt; frustration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned this to a number of people.  I mentioned it to Alan H&amp;aacute;jek at the 2004 AAP conference at which he presented the paper.  I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about it with some students here at Melbourne who&amp;rsquo;ve been worrying about this issue.  My line doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to convince &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; accept me.  Why is that? If you think it&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant to the considerations in the paper, or if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to reconfigure the example to make my worries not apply, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on other counterexamples to the &lt;em&gt;Avoid Certain Frustration Principle&lt;/em&gt;?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/phil/department/humberstone/&#34;&gt;Lloyd Humberstone&lt;/a&gt; mentioned this scenario to me today, which is in his &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/591843&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll Regret It&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  The scenario goes like this.  You&amp;rsquo;re going to bet $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; on a horse in the Melbourne Cup.  If the horse loses, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret having made the bet.  If the horse wins, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret not betting &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  In either case, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret having bet $&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; on the horse.  Isn&amp;rsquo;t that cute? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that this is a completely convincing counterexample to the principle, but it bears thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy: Question 1</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/04/19/masses_of_formal_philosophy_question_1/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/03/03/masses_of_formal_philosophy/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about Vincent Hendricks and John Symons&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions about &lt;em&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This seems like as good a place as any to answer them.  So, today, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a crack at the most autobiographical of the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-were-you-initially-drawn-to-formal-methods:895b75c074b128b5db21ffa1ccdb8ec4&#34;&gt;Why were you initially drawn to formal methods?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose the natural way to interpret this question is something like &amp;ldquo;why do formal methods rather than anything else in philosophy&amp;rdquo; but in my case I&amp;rsquo;d rather answer the related question &amp;ldquo;why, given that you&amp;rsquo;re interested in formal methods, apply them in philosophy rather than elsewhere.&amp;rdquo;  I started off my academic life as an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;undergraduate student in mathematics&lt;/a&gt;, because I was good at mathematics and studying it more seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed mathematics a great deal.  At the University of Queensland, where I was studying, there was a special cohort of &amp;ldquo;Honours&amp;rdquo; students right from the first year.  You were taught more research-oriented and rigourous subjects than were provided for the &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; students.  This meant that we had a small cohort of students, who knew each other pretty well, studied together and learned a lot.  I could see myself making an academic career in mathematics. (I surely couldn&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing anything other than an academic career.  Being around the university was too much fun.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was a fly in the ointment.  I was doing well in my studies, but I was losing the &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; for a great deal of the mathematics I was doing.  Applied mathematics went first, and analysis soon after.  I could do the work, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; it.  I wrote assignments by matching patterns from what I had written in my lecture notes, or what was in the text with what we were asked.  In exams, I just bashed away at the problem, sometimes when asked in an exam to prove that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d work at &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; from the top of a page and keep manipulating it until I&amp;rsquo;d got stuck.  Then I&amp;rsquo;d work &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, hoping to meet at somewhere rather like where I&amp;rsquo;d got stuck.  If I was honest, I&amp;rsquo;d write &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to get from here to there&amp;rdquo;.  If I was dishonest, I&amp;rsquo;d just leave the transition unexplained.  Knowing what I know now about marking assignments, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suprise me that I did very well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas where intuition and understanding lasted the longest (and which were most &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;) were topology, probability theory, combinatorics, set theory and logic.  There were so few honours subjects I really &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to do that in my last year I struck a deal with the mathematics department that I could do a reading course in logic with the newly arrived professor in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uq.edu.au/hprc/index.html?page=19718&#34;&gt;Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt;. The professor was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#graham&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;, and the reading course was my introduction to philosophical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very same time as I was wondering how to continue with academic life, I was very involved in Christian student things: in the little group I was in, I ran study groups, I organised meetings, I wrote publicity material, and I did a &lt;em&gt;bucketload&lt;/em&gt; of reading.  In particular, while trying to figure out what I believed about things (about a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of things), I read a lot of philosophy of religion and other philosophy written by Christians.  I found the philosophy more interesting, more rigourous and more accessible than a great deal of the &lt;em&gt;theology&lt;/em&gt; I had been reading.  This piqued my interest in doing more philosophy for myself.  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done much philosophy as an undergraduate (just two subjects), but I started trying to figure out how to do a major in Philosophy quickly, so that I could go on to postgraduate work in that field, rather than in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that my work with Graham Priest went so well that I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do more undergraduate study in Philosophy to start postgraduate work.  (That semester course resulted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, my first genuine academic publication.) I was offered a place in the Ph.D. program on the strength of my background in mathematics.  I was free to pursue my interest in philosophy, and logic was the bridge.  This meant that I could use the formal, mathematical skills that I had learned, on topics that interested me, and that I &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt;.  The mathematics was simple and manageable, it was applied to interesting issues, and I got to hang around with philosophers, who are interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Happy fifth birthday, Z!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it&amp;rsquo;s unwrapping presents, a quiet family breakfast and lego-making, talking to grand-dad on the telephone, a little practice on the new bike, some school, and dinner together with more fiddling around with the new presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Party&lt;/em&gt; is on Saturday.  (Wish us luck. We&amp;rsquo;ve not hosted a fifth birthday party before.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes technologies can be use for purposes the inventors didn&amp;rsquo;t really intend.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure that when the designers of the iTunes music store set the thing up, they didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that you&amp;rsquo;d be able to use it to download esoteric papers in philosophical logic.  But you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=138002605&amp;s=143460&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/consequentlyorg_in_itunes.png&#34; alt=&#34;consequently.org/writing in iTunes&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I had to do was submit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feed of my papers&lt;/a&gt; to the iTunes store &lt;a href=&#34;https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/publishPodcast&#34;&gt;on this form&lt;/a&gt;, after tweaking it to include the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/techspecs.html&#34;&gt;information that the iTunes store is looking for&lt;/a&gt;.  A day later, there it is.  Now you can use iTunes to automatically download any papers I write.  (Though, you can&amp;rsquo;t yet get them automatically downloaded onto your iPod for you to read, as the iPod doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a pdf reader &amp;ndash; at least not yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works since iTunes knows what to do with pdf files: if you buy tracks from the music store with lyrics or booklets, they can come as pdf files, which iTunes can store and hand over to your system to display.  My &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; that I use to serve up pointers to my recent publications has the same general structure as the feeds used in podcasting.  The difference is that my publications feed just contained pointers to webpages on which you could download pdf files, while podcasting feeds contain &lt;em&gt;enclosures&lt;/em&gt; of pdf files.  It was simple enough to tweak the feed to link to the pdf files directly as enclosures.  I did that &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/04/02/enclosures&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.  Then I submitted the feed to iTunes and here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=138002605&amp;amp;s=143460&#34;&gt;link to the me on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;.  Notice that the site features customer reviews.  Why don&amp;rsquo;t you write one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you publish papers online and would like people to get your stuff as conveniently as possible, then feel free to a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;my RSS Feed&lt;/a&gt; and use that as a template for your own.  As far as I can tell, using iTunes in this way is just a bit of a joke. (It gives me a laugh to see the feed appearing there, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect people to come across it very much or for those that do get to it that way to know what to do with it.) However, using feeds to enable subcriptions to documents, whether mp3 files, pdf files or anything else, will only become more prevalent in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next job is to enable feedreading for the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  That will require a fair bit of work.  Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m just handcoding the site. I&amp;rsquo;m awaiting the OK from the &lt;em&gt;Powers That Be&lt;/em&gt; for us to use some software on the server to facilitate more interesting communication (feeds for subscribing to papers, and comments on articles) for the journal.  I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know here when the system is in place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Shifty Salesman</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/04/05/the_shifty_salesman/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2006 12:16:16 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/04/05/the_shifty_salesman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Su Rogerson has brought to my attention a lovely rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/&#34;&gt;Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;, due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp05320&#34;&gt;Peter Geach&lt;/a&gt;, in his &lt;em&gt;Reason and Argument&lt;/em&gt; (Blackwell, 1976), pages 93&amp;ndash;95.  The discussion takes place at a car yard.  I&amp;rsquo;ll quote the discussion, interspersed with some commentary.  (I&amp;rsquo;m quoting from a draft of Su Rogerson&amp;rsquo;s thesis, and not from the text.  I&amp;rsquo;ll check this for correctness when I have access to the volume.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if, if I buy the car, you&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might suspect that this claim of the customer&amp;rsquo;s is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best starting point for a car purchase negotiation, and that rather too much is conceded straight away.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not quite right.  The customer has only conceded that the guarantee (conditional on the purchase) is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for the purchase, not sufficient.  (The claim is an &amp;lsquo;only if&amp;rsquo; not an &amp;lsquo;if&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that if you buy the car, then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it: what then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Then I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the crucial concession.  It&amp;rsquo;s all downhill from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Can I hold you to both the things you&amp;rsquo;ve just said?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer is going to regret saying that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Then you are logically committed to buying the car anyhow, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: What?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salesman is being a bit disingenuous at this point, but what he says is literally true, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: You say you&amp;rsquo;ll by the car only on condition that if you buy the car I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, I do say that: I&amp;rsquo;m not a complete idiot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: Well then: if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car, you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Uh-uh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But in logic &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is just a variant of &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;; so &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is equivalent to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: What on earth has that got to do with my buying the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of comments are worth making here.  (1) Beware of car salesmen who start spouting off dubious claims about logical equivalence. They&amp;rsquo;re up to something fishy.   (2) What on earth is the qualifier &amp;lsquo;in logic&amp;rsquo; doing in the salesman&amp;rsquo;s claim? Can&amp;rsquo;t the customer reply, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;in logic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m in a car yard trying to get out of my apparent commitment to buy this car&amp;rdquo;?  Surely it should be &amp;lsquo;in our study of logic, we&amp;rsquo;ve figured out that &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; not some claim about what&amp;rsquo;s true &amp;lsquo;in logic&amp;rsquo; as that makes us wonder about if it&amp;rsquo;s true elsewhere.   (3) The claim that &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and is &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is highly dubious in general, but here we don&amp;rsquo;t need to consider he niceties of the semantics and pragmatics of conditionals.  We just simply need to note that both &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; only if &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;if &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; entail the much weaker claim that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; materially implies &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; (that either &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is true or &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t) and read all other instances of &amp;lsquo;if &amp;hellip; then&amp;rsquo; in the dialogue as material conditionals. (4) The inference principle appealed to by the salesman is the inference of &lt;em&gt;contraction&lt;/em&gt; (from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) to &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;).  Perhaps if the customer had read &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/&#34;&gt;my thesis&lt;/a&gt; he or she might have had a chance at resisting the slide at this point.  But I doubt it.  (5) &lt;em&gt;This is a completely irrelevant aside&lt;/em&gt;. An exercise to the reader: Discuss whether or not it is, in fact, possible that a fictional character in a dialogue written in 1976 to read a Ph.D. thesis written nearly twenty years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On with the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: You said that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car, then you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.  But that, you see, is logically equivalent to saying that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Never mind what is logically equivalent to what!  Will you guarantee the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good objection.  Keep track of whether or not the salesman &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; addresses this point that the customer has made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m not saying anything about that just now.  You said &amp;ndash; remember? &amp;ndash; that I can hold you to what you&amp;rsquo;ve said.  And you&amp;rsquo;ve as good as said that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Well, yes, it looks as if I did say that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I am reminded of many Socratic dialogues, in which a hapless victim says &amp;ldquo;Well, yes, Socrates, it does appear that you&amp;rsquo;re right&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But you also said that, on condition that if you&amp;rsquo;ll but the car, I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it, you undertake you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: Yes I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: But you are logically committed, as we just saw, to saying that the condition you stipulated is fulfilled: namely, that if you&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car then I&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ndash; * &amp;ndash; ? * ! *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the customer says at this point, but it does seem to be not particularly polite.  If I were the customer, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thinking polite thoughts, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: So you&amp;rsquo;ve just got to buy the car, guarantee or no guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, either a sign of remarkable ignorance on the part of the salesman, or disingenuousness.  I leave it to you to decide which is the likelier explanation on the basis of the dialogue thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look at the customer&amp;rsquo;s next step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer&lt;/em&gt;: But I said that I&amp;rsquo;ll buy the car only if you&amp;rsquo;ll guarantee it.  So if I am going to buy the car &amp;ndash; as you pretend to have proved that I must &amp;ndash; you&amp;rsquo;ve got to guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha!  Good point.  Now, will the salesman address the issue of the guarantee?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesman&lt;/em&gt;: I don&amp;rsquo;t have to accept that.  You said I could hold you to what you said: that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.  I&amp;rsquo;m not bound by what you said, obviously.  So it&amp;rsquo;s a deal.  I see you have your Access card there, sir.  Thankyou very much, Sir. Please sign here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think?  Is the salesman as disingenuous as I have made out?  &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; the salesman have inferred that he will guarantee the car?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a way to make that plausible.  As shifty as the saleseman appears, it does seem that he&amp;rsquo;s right.  He&amp;rsquo;s helping the customer  see the consequences of what she/he has said.  Nothing he says commits *him*self to those claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it does seem to me that if the customer is still committed to the promise, then she/he is still committed to concluding that the salesman will guarantee the car.  In the face of manifest evidence that the salesman will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guarantee the car, then isn&amp;rsquo;t the appropriate thing to conclude that it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case that the customer will buy the car if and only if he/she will buy the car only if there&amp;rsquo;s a guarantee?  That is, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the customer take back the claim, or the conditional &lt;em&gt;promise&lt;/em&gt; to buy the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this actually breaking a commitment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think so, since the commitment has a factual consequence.  (If the commitment is &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; then the guarantee is made).  It&amp;rsquo;s as if I promise to bring wash up after you cook dinner tonight.  If you decide &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to cook dinner tonight, then there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I can do to wash up after you cook dinner.    It was a silly promise to make, as meeting is beyond my control. Circumstances can conspire to make it &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; (in those circumstances) for me to meet the promise.  Similarly in the salesman case.  If the customer is committed to seeing to it that he/she purchases the car if and only if, he/she purchases the car only if it is guaranteed, then a consequent commitment is to see to it that the guarantee is made.  If that&amp;rsquo;s outside the control of the customer, the commitment cannot be met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I reckon, the customer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t sign!  Don&amp;rsquo;t buy the car.  An especially, don&amp;rsquo;t trust car salesmen who appear to know a lot of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Su Rogerson for telling me about this wonderful dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally added enclosures to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feed of papers&lt;/a&gt;.  This means that if you subscribe to my papers page using that feed, and you&amp;rsquo;re using an RSS reader that handles enclosures (this feature is primarily used for podcasts), then you can get it to download my papers automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the side effect that you can subscribe to me in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/itunes&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.  (I wonder if I should submit this podcast to the iTunes Music Store?)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to neaten up this place a bit, and I need your help and advice.  Have a look &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/newindex.php&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think of it.  I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make it easier to see what&amp;rsquo;s new, what&amp;rsquo;s changed, etc.  In particular, you look &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to find links to other new stuff on the site.  This opens up the sidebars for four things.  The most recent picture, my &amp;ldquo;recently browsed&amp;rdquo; linklist, my list of events (which I need to update) and finally, a very modest list of links to friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think?  Clearer?  Simpler?  Easier to understand?  Or not?  Does it break in your browser?  Leave a comment and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AJL Papers</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/30/ajl_papers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2006 10:44:34 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/30/ajl_papers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I uploaded a few new papers to the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, one of the projects I (mostly!) enjoy working on.  It&amp;rsquo;s an open access, fully refereed, online journal in logic.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve not seen it before, browse around and check it out.  Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that an online journals make possible is the freedom from constraints of filling a fixed number of fixed-size volumes a year.  Different ejournals do this differently.  At the AJL, we publish one volume per year, but papers appear in the volume whenever they complete the refereeing and editing process.  We close the volume at the end of the year, and start a new one in the next year.  This means that wherever one paper is in the queue doesn&amp;rsquo;t block the progress of any other paper.  We can publish Tony Roy&amp;rsquo;s massive 146 page &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2006/index.html#3&#34;&gt;Natural Derivations for Priest &lt;em&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without worrying that this will delay the other things in the queue until the next volume.  Tony&amp;rsquo;s paper has meant that we&amp;rsquo;ve well-and-truly broken our pagecount record for the 2006 volume, and we&amp;rsquo;re only in March.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spooky coincidence? I think not</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/28/spooky_coincidence_i_think_not/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2006 20:42:07 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/28/spooky_coincidence_i_think_not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today in &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; I talked about vagueness and the sorites paradox.  Then when I get back to the office, I find that this Saturday, Alan Saunders on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/philosopher&#34;&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/a&gt; has a program on &amp;ndash; you guessed it &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/philosopher/stories/s1591158.htm&#34;&gt;the sorites paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  Is that a spooky coincidence or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not spooky.  It&amp;rsquo;s just a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from the little outline, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that Saunders has a more adept journalistic sense of what can get a point across than me.  His example (is &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=bruce%20willis&#34;&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt; bald?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=peter%20garrett&#34;&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt; definitely is, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.google.com/images?q=billy%20connolly&#34;&gt;Billy Connolly&lt;/a&gt; definately isn&amp;rsquo;t, but what to say of Bruce?) is much nicer than my boring examples of strips of colour shading from red to yellow, or heaps of grains of sand or the other stock philosophical examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the class had a pretty energetic discussion, from people trying on different responses to the paradox, to other students pushing pretty hard on the &amp;ldquo;just stop doing logic if it produces problems like this&amp;rdquo; sort of line.  I like these sort of questions &amp;ndash; at least if they&amp;rsquo;re attempts to get to grips with the issues, as they seemed to be to me &amp;ndash; because they&amp;rsquo;re a sign that when you do something like logic, it&amp;rsquo;s our job to address the philosophical or interpretive issues of what is going on.  This is why I like doing the sorites paradox and vagueness around halfway through an intro course, as it gets to the heart of the issue of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing when we talk about truth values and the machinery of classical propositional logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after the class, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear to me if I did a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good job of addressing the issues that came up in the discussion.  So, my readers, it&amp;rsquo;s with some trepidation that I&amp;rsquo;m going to point you to the lectures for the subject.  They&amp;rsquo;re recorded and can be found online (at least, until next year when they&amp;rsquo;ll be overwritten or archived or somesuch).  If you can bear it (and have nothing better to do for 50 minutes or so), take a listen to the March 28 recording &lt;a href=&#34;http://harangue.lecture.unimelb.edu.au/ilectures/ilectures.lasso?skip=0&amp;amp;ut=589&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are the disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording starts with me asking if anyone has a nine volt battery.  The wireless microphone was dead, and needed a new battery.  A nice person from Teaching Space Services delivered the battery just as the lecture started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing on the whiteboard.  The people there can see it but you can&amp;rsquo;t.  I wrote down the form of a sorites argument, discussed in the last class (setting a series of colours, each apparently indistinguishable from the next, shading from what looks to red to what looks to yellow), what makes the thing a paradox (the premises seem true and the conclusion seems false and the argument seems valid), and some options for responding to the tension of the paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of questions from the class (good questions), but they don&amp;rsquo;t all get picked up from the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sound &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; but that might just be my reaction to hearing my own voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the issue, or if you want to give me some feedback on this class, listen and post here.  If you are a &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/prot&#34;&gt;161-115&lt;/a&gt; student (I know some of you read this thing) please feel free to post comments too.   I&amp;rsquo;m up for getting tips on teaching.  Especially on dealing with questions from the floor.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with how I dealt with all of the student questions, so tips and comments will be most helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oh, and there&#39;s another paper, too</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/28/oh_and_theres_another_paper_too/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention that I have written another paper recently.  It&amp;rsquo;s a proof theory paper, putting down some thoughts on modal proof theory that I formulated when giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;S5 paper&lt;/a&gt; around and about in the last six months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal/&#34;&gt;Comparing Modal Sequent Systems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I look at different ways to understand modal deduction.  In particular, I argue that you can understand &lt;em&gt;labelled&lt;/em&gt; proof systems &amp;ndash; those in which proofs consist of statements annotated with labels, often thought of as denoting &amp;lsquo;possible worlds&amp;rsquo; at least in modal proof theory &amp;ndash; can be reconceived in such a way as to not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; require talk of worlds.  When you play close attention to the kind of work done by the labels, it can be understood instead as a different representation of a &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; feature of modal deduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point in this paper is a technical one, but the moral is broader than that.  The view I argue for in the &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;Invention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; paper feeds off this kind of point.  Properly &lt;em&gt;modal&lt;/em&gt; deduction involves doing new things in the structure of argument &amp;ndash; you can do a kind of &lt;em&gt;supposing&lt;/em&gt; (say, &amp;lsquo;hypothetical&amp;rsquo; supposing), which has its own interesting behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I think, anyway.  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; paper I look the issue by way of a comparison between labelled deduction and display logic.  Display Logic is maligned for being complicated, but not for failing to be &amp;lsquo;structural.&amp;rsquo;  No-one accuses Display Logic of importing explicit talk possible worlds into proofs.  Labelled deduction is criticised for doing exactly that, but it has nice properties.  In the paper, I show how you can get from display logic to Labelled Deduction, and thereby get a new view on labelled modal systems, inheriting some of the &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; features of display logic, but which has its own kind of simplicity and charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a logician, I&amp;rsquo;d love to know what you think of it.  Download it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/comparingmodal&#34;&gt;leave a comment&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve submitted it for presentation at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~aiml06/&#34;&gt;AiML 2006&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey.  Look at that.  Two posts in one day.  Even with some philosophico-logical content.  I think I can make it three&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being a logician means sometimes having to say that you&#39;re sorry.  Or at least, that you&#39;re wrong.</title>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/28/being_a_logician_means_sometimes_having_to_say_that_youre_sorry_or_at_least_that_youre_wrong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I truly am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the period 1990-1992, I wrote a couple of papers on the semantics of relevant logics.  I thought they were pretty nifty, and I submitted them to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;amp;issn=0022-3611&#34;&gt;prestigious journal&lt;/a&gt;.  They got accepted.  The first of these papers is &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/simpsem/&#34;&gt;Simplified Semantics for Relevant Logics (and some of their rivals)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatley, there&amp;rsquo;s a hole in the middle of this paper.  That&amp;rsquo;s the problem with being a logician, people can sometimes &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; you wrong by presenting a counterexample to your claim.  That&amp;rsquo;s the nice thing about playing a game with relatively clear rules.  You can figure out what constitutes good play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cal.csusb.edu/Faculty/Philosophy/roy/&#34;&gt;Tony Roy&lt;/a&gt; did a fantastic job of isolating the problem, which exists in not only my paper, but Graham Priest&amp;rsquo;s text &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/052179434X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which followed the simplified semantics rather closely.   The problem is serious, for in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; semantics for the relevant logic  R, it turns out that disjunctive syllogism (the inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; v &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and ~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is valid, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony isolated the problem, and we came up with a fix.  The result is the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/permutation&#34;&gt;On Permutation in Simplified Semantics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  Please take a look over it before we sent it off to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and to the greater philosophical community (or at least, the tiny fraction that has come across this paper) &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for deceiving you.  I hope this paper helps make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little spot called Melbourne&lt;br /&gt;
Is the city of my birth&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s not as hot as Brisbane&lt;br /&gt;
or as far away as Perth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not as small as Adelaide,&lt;br /&gt;
Compared to Canberra, it&amp;rsquo;s bliss,&lt;br /&gt;
And if you&amp;rsquo;ve been to Melbourne,&lt;br /&gt;
You can give Sydney a miss&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world gets scarier,&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty decent area&lt;br /&gt;
Melbourne&lt;br /&gt;
The envy of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://smh.com.au/news/commonwealth-games/melbourne-we-did-it/2006/03/26/1143330923113.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; was a knowing, self-reflective and ironic appropriation of Australian (and Melburnian) parochialism, but I&amp;rsquo;m not altogether sure about how the irony was received, given the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tvguide.ninemsn.com.au/cu/default.asp?pid=14286318&#34;&gt;insipid television commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, anything a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries&#34;&gt;72 year old bloke in drag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dame-edna.com/&#34;&gt;with purple hair&lt;/a&gt; who shot to fame (such fame as it was) knowingly making fun of Melbourne suburban life and other Australian attitudes can&amp;rsquo;t be all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last Night at the MCG</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/25/last_night_at_the_mcg/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2006 08:40:25 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/25/last_night_at_the_mcg/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Z and I &amp;ndash; together with around 80,000 other people &amp;ndash; filled the MCG to watch the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule+and+Results/By+Sport/Athletics?SelectedDate=Fri%2024%20Mar&#34;&gt;track and field portion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://melbourne2006.com/M2006/Daily+Summaries/Day+9&#34;&gt;Day 9&lt;/a&gt; of the Commonwealth Games here.  Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The completed renovations at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcg.org.au/&#34;&gt;MCG&lt;/a&gt; make the huge stadium very easy to navigate.  We got there early, so had no long queues to deal with (once we were at the ground itself &amp;ndash; it was another matter on the train network).  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get in and out of the ground, the seats were comfortable, the view was good on Deck 2 of the Olympic Stand, and once the stadium filled up, you understood why the MCG is such a popular venue.  It fits &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many people, yet you feel very close to the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd was good-natured.  Much alcohol was consumed by some of our neighbours (the trip to the bar was very short, and repeatedly taken), but any drunks were quiet and happy drunks, not loud and angry ones.  We were, as a whole, terribly parochially Australian, but not without occasional flashes of appreciation for athletes of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One crowd favourite in the latter category was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=108139&#34;&gt;Sapolai Yao&lt;/a&gt;, the 1.52 metre tall distance runner from PNG who earned the appreciation of the crowd by enthusiastically completing the 3km steeplechase, &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; managing to hold off being lapped by the lead Kenyan runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One crowd favourite in the other category were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=109976&#34;&gt;Steve Hooker&lt;/a&gt; who pole vaulted a Games&amp;rsquo; record.  He entred the competition with a jump at 5.6 metres, when most of the other competitors had failed to make that height or lower.  He flew over the bar and with his first jump it was obvious that he could go much higher.  He easily cleared 5.7 and 5.8, winning the Gold medal at 5.6 when the remaining competitor, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110387&#34;&gt;Dmitri Markov&lt;/a&gt; failed at 5.7 and 5.75  He tried for a personal best of 6.01, but despite the crowd support, he didn&amp;rsquo;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other crowd heroes were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110182&#34;&gt;Stuart Rendell&lt;/a&gt; who threw a games record in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Fri%2024%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT0054E0100001?ScheduleItemID=29054&#34;&gt;Hammer Throw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Participants/Participants?ID=110268&#34;&gt;Bronwyn Thompson&lt;/a&gt; who set a new Games record in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Fri%2024%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT1061E0100001?ScheduleItemID=29066&#34;&gt;Long Jump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miscellaneous moments of drama: the Australian &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=110080&#34;&gt;Sally McLellan&lt;/a&gt; crashed &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the last hurdle in the Women&amp;rsquo;s 100m, to be disqualified.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=103859&#34;&gt;Marlon Devonish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/participants?id=103885&#34;&gt;Mark Lewis-Francis&lt;/a&gt; from the English Men&amp;rsquo;s 4x100m relay team fluffed the baton change.  They weren&amp;rsquo;t very happy with that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nearly-five-year-old can have a wonderful time with a very late night, cheering madly, and looking gog-eyed at all of the people, all of the strange things they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and making his own plans for a future pole-vault career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these moments are captured in the photos from March on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;photo page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marathon Effort</title>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/19/marathon_effort/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Z and I went in to the city to have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT1099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28953&#34;&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule%20and%20Results/By%20Sport/Athletics/Sun%2019%20Mar/Results/Result%20-%20AT0099E0100001?ScheduleItemID=28935&#34;&gt;Men&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Marathon held here for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/&#34;&gt;2006 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;.  The city was buzzing, the crowds friendly, and it was great to get a glimpse of the lead runners: especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Kerryn%20McCann%20and%20Hellen%20Cheron%20Koskei,%20Commonwealth%20Games%20Marathon,%20Alexandra%20Gardens,%20March%2019,%202006.jpg&#34;&gt;Kerryn McCann and Hellen Cherono Koskei&lt;/a&gt; who raced neck-and-neck right into the stadium.  No matter how you cut it, 42+ kilometres is a long way to run.  I suppose the task is quite literally, a &lt;em&gt;marathon&lt;/em&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C arrived with lunch when the marathon had finished, and our afternoon was wrapped up with some great live music from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Performances/profiles/Ravi+Bandhu+Vidyapathy.htm&#34;&gt;Ravi Bandhu Vidyapathy&lt;/a&gt; and friends from Sri Lanka, at the Festival site down at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Festival+Melbourne2006/Locations/Alexandra+Gardens.htm&#34;&gt;Alexandra Gardens&lt;/a&gt;.  Even for people who have a middling interest in sport, like me, the Commonweath Games has brought its own kind of spark into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch out for Friday night, when Z and I head down to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne2006.com.au/Schedule+and+Results/By+Sport/Athletics?SelectedDate=Fri%2024%20Mar&#34;&gt;athletics at the MCG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Masses of Formal Philosophy</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/03/masses_of_formal_philosophy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2006 09:35:09 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/03/03/masses_of_formal_philosophy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Vincent Hendricks and John Symons are working on a sequel to their book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/&#34;&gt;Formal Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in which philosophers who use &amp;ldquo;formal methods&amp;rdquo; talked about their work, their motivations, and their take on the state of philosophy.  For the sequel, they are opening things up for others to take an &amp;ldquo;interview&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.formalphilosophy.com/Masses/index.html&#34;&gt;five questions&lt;/a&gt;, to appear in the next book, &lt;em&gt;Masses of Formal Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the criteria Vincent and John are using for selecting answers for appearing in the book &amp;ndash; but I am thinking about their five questions.  Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why were you initially drawn to formal methods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What example(s) from your work (or the work of others) illustrates the role formal methods can play in philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the proper role of philosophy in relation to other disciplines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you consider the most neglected topics and/or contributions in late 20th century philosophy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the most important open problems in philosophy and what are the prospects for progress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These look like interesting questions to think about.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll post some draft answers here first, for feedback, and if I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the result, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it off to Vincent and John for consideration.  If you work in this area, you might consider doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Does it sound like a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Toby Ord (a former student of mine, now taking Oxford by storm), has written up a nice short essay on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/degrees/&#34;&gt;degrees of truth and degrees of falsity&lt;/a&gt;.  It shows how you can get a very nice little algebra if you extend the usual non-classical idea of a 4-valued logic in which truth and falsity are somewhat independent with the &amp;ldquo;fuzzy&amp;rdquo; idea of degrees of truth between zero and one. Both ideas have a heritage.  The idea of considering the interval [0,1] as a lattice of truth values goes back to &amp;#321;ukasiewicz, and the four-valued algebra, now known as BN4, traces back at least to some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citeulike.org/user/greg_restall/article/123362&#34;&gt;early work by Mike Dunn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toby considers nice properties of this little algebra.  It seems to me that a good exercise for someone who likes fiddling with concrete algebras would be this: define a conditional &amp;rarr; on the algebra such that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when restricted to the fuzzy interval [0,1] it agrees with &amp;#321;ukasiewicz&amp;rsquo;s conditional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when restricted to the values &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; agrees with the usual BN4 conditional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has as many natural properties as possible.  In particular, defining &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; fuse &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; as ~(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; ~&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) gives an associative and commutative operator, and fusion is connected with the conditional by means of the usual residuation postulates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a nice concrete lattice which is a model for multiplicative and additive linear logic (and a little bit more &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s distributive), and I&amp;rsquo;ll have a nice example to talk about in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/HB/subjects/161-212.html&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, please go and read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/degrees/&#34;&gt;Toby&amp;rsquo;s Essay&lt;/a&gt;, complete my exercise, and let me know what you come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally joined the ranks of the zombies with white earbuds.  My trusty 2GB black &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ipodnano&#34;&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; was acquired on the way home from our Sabbatical, in a duty free store at Changi Airport.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a little while to experiment with it, and so far, it&amp;rsquo;s been working better than I&amp;rsquo;d expected.  I take it with me on my early morning walks, sometimes listening to spoken word things and sometimes listening to music.  My taste in podcasts is &lt;a href=&#34;http://theblog.philosophytalk.org/2006/01/the_best_of_phi.html&#34;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lnl/&#34;&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I seem to treat this as time-shifted radio, rather than anything more cutting-edge.  However, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty mind-bending that you can get &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dur.ac.uk/kevin.bywater/&#34;&gt;esoteric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usyd.edu.au/time/conferences/Brandom-2005.htm&#34;&gt;seminars&lt;/a&gt; off the web, so academic seminars I&amp;rsquo;m interested in but didn&amp;rsquo;t go to can be downloaded onto my computer and put on the iPod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fun seeing how to get my middling sized (20+GB) music collection into my very svelte (2GB) iPod.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how I do that, read on.   It&amp;rsquo;s a long post, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing anything else this evening as I&amp;rsquo;ve sprained my ankle and I&amp;rsquo;m lying down giving my foot a rest.  It&amp;rsquo;s just the time to write a long blog post you&amp;rsquo;ve been ruminating on for a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executive summary goes like this: you can live really well with a small iPod, and the &amp;ldquo;smart playlists&amp;rdquo; in iTunes help you get a nice mix of unpredictability and choice in keeping your iPod fed with music.  Oh, and knowing some elementary logic helps too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;rsquo;s the story.  Hold on for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aim is to load up my iPod with music and other audio I want to listen to at the moment; podcasts I&amp;rsquo;m subscribing to; stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to recently but &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, and stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve recently ripped from a CD or downloaded from one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://3hive.com&#34;&gt;free, legal MP3 sites on the web&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like just listening to a big random &lt;em&gt;mush&lt;/em&gt; of stuff on my computer, so just loading a random selection of material from iTunes onto the iPod doesn&amp;rsquo;t appeal to me.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to just listen to the things &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; choose to put on the machine either.  If I were to do that, I&amp;rsquo;d just cycle through my favourites like I do with my CD collection.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a computer here, and computers are good at &lt;em&gt;computing&lt;/em&gt;, so I may as well use some of this computational power to figure out some of what I can listen to.   I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the synchronicity of new stuff bubbling up out of the mix as well as what I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen.  So, I wanted to find a way to mix choice and serendipity.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set up iTunes to sync some of the playlists on my computer to the iPod.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the setting in the preferences for iTunes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/ipod_playlist_settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;playlist settings in iTunes&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set the system up to sync playlists to sync &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; of my playlists onto the iPod.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the list of playlists in the sidebar of the iTunes window.  I&amp;rsquo;ve filed them away in the &amp;ldquo;* iPod Management&amp;rdquo; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/list_of_playlists.png&#34; alt=&#34;list of playlists&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much work to manage nine playlists each time I wanted to fill my iPod up with music, but this works, since all but one of the playlists is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://smartplaylists.com/&#34;&gt;smart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (they&amp;rsquo;re the purple playlists, with gear on the icon).  iTunes updates the playlist and chooses music on the basis of criteria that you set up.  If I want to choose music to put on the iPod, it goes in the (you guessed it) &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist.  I&amp;rsquo;ve named it with a reminder that I should put around 1GB on there.  (If I put any more on, my playlists will overfill my iPod, and iTunes will tell me that not everything will fit.)   It&amp;rsquo;s usually in the &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist that I put entire albums that I&amp;rsquo;m listening to, or talks I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded that I want to listen to, then file away or delete. This is pretty standard, I suppose.  It&amp;rsquo;s 1GB of my 2GB iPod: It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more than a half of its storage for sound, as I store a few photos (around 186 at the moment: my five star photos from my collection) and my calendar too.  This other stuff takes up a few megabytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; playlists that do the work in getting stuff on the iPod automatically.  Four of these playlists collect files to put on the iPod. Two of them (&lt;em&gt;Not Recent 4 Stars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 5 stars&lt;/em&gt;) choose highly rated songs that I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to lately.  They&amp;rsquo;re smart playlists with the following conditions.  First, the 5-star playlist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;five stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;266MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;least recently played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the 4-star playlist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;four stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;100MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;least recently played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the playlists &lt;em&gt;Choices&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 4 Stars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Not Recent 5 Stars&lt;/em&gt; are disjoint.  No track can appear on more than one of these playlists.   So we have around 1.36GB on the iPod so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two playlists select music I like (not Spoken Word stuff, and not Kids&amp;rsquo; music &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t want tracks from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thewiggles.com.au&#34;&gt;The Wiggles&lt;/a&gt; to appear on my iPod without my foreknowledge!  I just put them on in the &amp;ldquo;Choices&amp;rdquo; playlist if we&amp;rsquo;re giving the iPod to Zachary on a long drive or flight or something).  These playlists select more 5-star tracks than 4-star tracks, as I like 5-star tracks more than 4-star tracks.  (At least, when I rate something 5-star, I mean &amp;ldquo;this is really great &amp;ndash; I could listen to this again and again and again, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine getting bored of this&amp;rdquo; and when I rate something 4-star, I mean &amp;ldquo;this is a great track &amp;ndash; I want to listen to this again regularly.&amp;rdquo;)  So, &lt;em&gt;ratings&lt;/em&gt; help make this system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do &lt;em&gt;playcounts&lt;/em&gt;.  iTunes keeps track of two pieces of information for every track &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;how many times it&amp;rsquo;s been played&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;when it was last played&lt;/em&gt;.  The really cool feature is that playcount information is copied from the iPod into iTunes each time you
sync the iPod.  This means that if I&amp;rsquo;m playing a track through iTunes at home or at work, or through my iPod when I&amp;rsquo;m on the move, iTunes is keeping track of that. So, things not recently played are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not recently played.  (We recently acquired an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/&#34;&gt;AirPort Express&lt;/a&gt; which means that I can play from iTunes through our sound system at home.  It&amp;rsquo;s really neat!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other playlists help me get things rated.  First, &lt;em&gt;Unrated Most Played&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Rating&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;empty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;82MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;most often played&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These get tracks that are unrated onto the iPod. When I listen to an unrated track on the iPod, I try to rate it when I first play it.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t rate songs much before getting the iPod.  Now it chooses unrated songs, in order of frequency played.  Notice that the tracks on this playlist cannot be in any of the other playlists so far, so now we have around 1.44GB on the iPod.  No more, but probably a little bit less because of rounding (if I limit to 82MB, it&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;em&gt;upper&lt;/em&gt; limit &amp;ndash; at the moment I write this, the playlist has 78.6MB worth of tracks, not 82MB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the rest of the music on the iPod?  The last playlist in this batch chooses recent stuff:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playcount&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Spoken Word&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Not recent 4 Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playlist&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;Not recent 5 Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit to &lt;strong&gt;300MB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected by &lt;strong&gt;most recently added&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently added into iTunes, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet played.  This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; necessarily disjoint with the other playlists (exercise for the reader: find the circumstances in which a track is on this playlist and another one on the iPod &amp;ndash; that should tell you why I don&amp;rsquo;t care about this happening).  It puts things I&amp;rsquo;ve recently added to iTunes into the iPod, for listening and rating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is around 1.74GB (usually less than 1.65GB, with all that approximation) of stuff on the iPod. But I can fit more than that on a 2GB iPod, even with photos and calendars.  The rest is the &lt;em&gt;Podcasts&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed to and decided to upload into the iPod.  Here, I subscribe to a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/default.htm&#34;&gt;ABC Radio National&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rrr.org.au/byteintoit/&#34;&gt;Triple R&lt;/a&gt; (community radio based here in Melbourne) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://theblog.philosophytalk.org/2006/01/the_best_of_phi.html#more&#34;&gt;Philosophy Talk&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s nice that some programs (like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/services/podcasting.htm&#34;&gt;ABC&amp;rsquo;s podcasts&lt;/a&gt;) tell you the approximate filesize of their podcasts, which helps people like me who sync one episode from each subscription to an iPod.  This way I can tell that podcasts take up around 100MB, so my playlists won&amp;rsquo;t take my iPod over the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s how tracks get on the iPod.  The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; playlists help me access these tracks.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/itunes/playlist_chart.png&#34; alt=&#34;playlist chart&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Everything&amp;rdquo; playlist contains everything on the five playlists I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned.   (It&amp;rsquo;s a smart playlist just selecting the stuff on the other playlists.)  It&amp;rsquo;s there because I use it to construct my other playlists.  Two are simple.  &lt;em&gt;?Unrated&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that are yet to be rated.  &lt;em&gt;!Hits&lt;/em&gt; selects tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that are rated four or five stars.  Sometimes I want to listen to the 4- and 5-star tracks, chosen at random.  This is for when I want to enjoy some music and not particularly worry about &lt;em&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt; it.  Sometimes I want to evaluate things (I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in a tram and I want to rate some more of my music so that it&amp;rsquo;s in &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo;), so I use the &lt;em&gt;?Unrated&lt;/em&gt; playlist. (The punctuation marks &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; put these playlists at the top of the list in the iPod.)  Finally, when I&amp;rsquo;m working and I want to listen to music, most often I want music &lt;em&gt;without words&lt;/em&gt;, which would compete with the words I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write.  So, &lt;em&gt;Instrumental&lt;/em&gt; picks out tracks from &lt;em&gt;Everything&lt;/em&gt; that contain the string &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; in the comments field.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got around to tagging 50% of my music as &amp;ldquo;Vocal&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo;, so this is not yet complete.  At the moment &amp;ldquo;Instrumental&amp;rdquo; on the iPod contains 500MB of music, chiefly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0000042HV%2Fqid%3D1139043132%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dclassical%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D5174&#34;&gt;late Shostakovich String Quartets&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00002EPJH%2F&#34;&gt;Keith Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=consequentlyorg&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00006EXHT%2F&#34;&gt;Anouar Brahem&lt;/a&gt;, lasting more than 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the system.  It seems to work for me.  I get new stuff on the iPod each time I sync (mostly, if I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to anything or rated anything) and I have control over what I put on it as well.  It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of control and serendipity.  When I&amp;rsquo;ve rated more things on the iPod, I can modify the sizes on the playlists to suit, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the general scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little familiarity with classical propositional logic helps when constructing smart playlists.  They&amp;rsquo;ll be an example when I teach first-year &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; this year. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice thing to think about: if a single condition on a playlist is a propositional literal, and a smart playlist is a conjunction or disjunction of literals, then what is a track in your library?  Is the playlist &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; rich enough to discriminate between &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; two tracks?  Can it construct arbitrary boolean combinations of the conditions?  (&lt;em&gt;Exercise to the reader&lt;/em&gt;.  What happen when you set up two playlists in iTunes: &lt;em&gt;Playlist A&lt;/em&gt; contains tracks on &lt;em&gt;Playlist B&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;Playlist B&lt;/em&gt; contains tracks &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Playlist A&lt;/em&gt;.  That is, what is Apple&amp;rsquo;s account of the liar paradox?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five rating stars are a little bit &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than I need.  I mostly &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the music I have on my iPod, and I have more 4-star tracks than tracks between 3 and 1 stars.  I have tried to be more discriminating (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jwz.livejournal.com/578440.html&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/2006/01/stars.html&#34;&gt;guys&lt;/a&gt;, but my judgements about music seem to be much more context-relative than linear.  My preference ranking between (1) a Keith Jarrett rendition of a jazz standard, (2) a movement of a Shostakovich string quartet, (3) a grand performance of the last movement of Beethoven&amp;rsquo;s 9th, (4) Bruce Cockburn singing with righteous indignation and finger-picking skill, and (5) a finely structured minimalist piece by Arvo P&amp;auml;rt simply &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; linearizable beyond selecting them all as either &lt;em&gt;hmm, OK&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; (and, I suppose &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t tend to rip irredemably bad stuff into iTunes if I can help it).   A track can be great without being great-to-play-all-the-time, and I let my &amp;ldquo;skip track&amp;rdquo; finger do the talking when I&amp;rsquo;m not in the mood for that &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of musical greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playcounts and last-played dates are just &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt;.  Since most of the music I play flows through iTunes, the database has a good representation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to.  This is one reason to prefer an &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/ipodnano&#34;&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; over an &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/ipodshuffle&#34;&gt;iPod shuffle&lt;/a&gt;.  A shuffle will update your &lt;em&gt;playcounts&lt;/em&gt; if you set it to sync, but since the little thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clock, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t update the information about when the track wasn&amp;rsquo;t last played.  Without that, the whole thing won&amp;rsquo;t work.  We were tossing up between getting a shuffle and getting a nano, and this (together with the gorgeous screen, and the fact that 1GB shuffles weren&amp;rsquo;t available in London, Oxford or Singapore when I was looking) was enough to tip the balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/01/05/dos_and_donts_&#34;&gt;what you need to do to make a viable competitor to the iPod and iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mention the ease of getting music (and other stuff) onto the player.  This is where the whole Apple thing works so well.  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get stuff onto the iPod, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to navigate through it when it&amp;rsquo;s on there, and the information you can use (ratings, playcounts, etc.) is kept and made accessible. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy to use &amp;ndash; both at an elementary level and also a sophisticated one &amp;ndash; and the other media players I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at have nothing to match it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now approach my music in a new way.  I&amp;rsquo;m listening to old stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to lately, and I&amp;rsquo;m actually weeding &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from my music library stuff I&amp;rsquo;ll never listen to again, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself the question: is this good enough to listen to again?  I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my music more, as I can be surprised by an old friend or make a new musical acquaintance on the tram on the way to work, or taking a morning walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to eke out &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the space on the iPod.  The more playlists you have like mine, the more the rounding-off adds up and you are left with a little bit of space on the iPod &amp;ndash; maybe enough for two or three or more tracks, but it depens on what is  on each of the playlists.  You could optimise this by limiting playlists not by a set amount, but by an amount which is some function of the size of other playlists.  (Instead of getting 300MB of music, get 400MB minus the size of the &amp;ldquo;Podcasts&amp;rdquo; playlist, for example.)  That would satisfy my sense of frugality and elegance, but, alas, I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a way of designing a user interface for that which would make sense in the &lt;em&gt;Smart Playlists&lt;/em&gt; dialog so I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is the kind of thing Apple is going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I do at the moment.  Thanks to my cousin &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uts.edu.au/fac/edu/ostaff/staff/peter_devries.html&#34;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, who asked me how I used my iPod.  (Peter asks this kind of question &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uts.edu.au/fac/edu/ostaff/staff/peter_devries.html&#34;&gt;for a living&lt;/a&gt;.) This is the long, &lt;em&gt;technical&lt;/em&gt; explanation of the &lt;em&gt;mechanics&lt;/em&gt;.  After  I&amp;rsquo;ve used it some more, I might post again about how my relationship to the music (and to the other podcast audio) has developed and changed with more experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use an iPod or something like it, how do you manage it?  What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assorted crosscultural observations, upon visiting the supermarket</title>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2006/01/04/assorted_crosscultural_observations_upon_visiting_the_supermarket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning found Z and me in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coles.com.au/&#34;&gt;grocery store&lt;/a&gt;, doing yet more re-stocking of the pantry.  Here are some hastily selected observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic and fairtrade food has &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; higher market presence in the UK than in Australia.  Our nearest &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shoppingandservices/storelocator/searchresults.htm?query=ox2+8jj&#34;&gt;Sainsbury&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; more organic products than can be found in either of the two &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coles.com.au/&#34;&gt;major&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolworths.com.au/&#34;&gt;chains&lt;/a&gt; here in Australia.  In our local supermarket, the paltry selection of organic products is filed away in the small &amp;ldquo;health food&amp;rdquo; section, than distributed through the relevant parts of the shop.  This makes comparison with other products difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s much more fresh food available in Australia, and correspondingly fewer pre-prepared meals.  Don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started talking about that UK phenomenon &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iceland.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. No, it does not feature Icelandic cuisine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pauls.com.au/products/brands_details.cfm?/section/2/cid/1/pid/1/&#34;&gt;2 Litre plastic milk bottle&lt;/a&gt; looks very odd once you&amp;rsquo;ve been buying milk in the UK for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, my readers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve landed in Melbourne (to a hot 8pm at around 42 degrees Celcius), and are slowly reconstructing our household bit by bit.  The internet connection seems to work at least.  We&amp;rsquo;ve managed to change lightbulbs, unpack bags, look at a bit of our large pile of mail, get the boy to bed (and even to sleep) and have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yakun.com/&#34;&gt;Kaya Toast&lt;/a&gt; for a midnight or New Year snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you later in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About to leave Oxford</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/12/16/about_to_leave_oxford/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2005 12:22:40 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/12/16/about_to_leave_oxford/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of packing up our Oxford home, to start the short trip back.  We land in Melbourne on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve, after some stops in K&amp;ouml;ln (for the Christmas Markets), Augsburg (for Christmas with friends), Frankfurt Airport (to get on the plane), Singapore (to break the journey, and give us some summer in close proximity to air conditioning before landing in the Melbourne summer heat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s too much to say in the limited time I&amp;rsquo;ve got online here, but here&amp;rsquo;s just a taste of what&amp;rsquo;s been going on.  Academic highlights in the last few weeks have involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge&lt;/em&gt;.  I zipped over to Cambridge on the bus (though &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mkweb.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Milton Keynes&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very strange city, at least when viewed from the window of a bus) for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/novmeeting.html&#34;&gt;CAMELEON workshop&lt;/a&gt; organised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/&#34;&gt;Tom Forster&lt;/a&gt;.  It was great to meet Tom, and also &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/&#34;&gt;Randall Holmes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amsta.leeds.ac.uk/Pure/staff/rathjen/rathjen.html&#34;&gt;Michael Rathjen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://math.colorado.edu/~almann/&#34;&gt;Allen Mann&lt;/a&gt; (who all presented papers), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/&#34;&gt;Martin Hyland&lt;/a&gt;, who gave me useful feedback on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;paper I presented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris&lt;/em&gt;.  My &lt;a href=&#34;http://theoreme.blogspot.com/2005/12/greg-restall.html&#34;&gt;visit&lt;/a&gt; there was &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/&#34;&gt;IHSPT&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful place, with lots of nice people (a fantastic bunch of students who managed to make me eat my lunch or dinner very slowly by asking Interesting Questions and making me think Very Hard), together with a gorgeous city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utrecht&lt;/em&gt;.  Where I enjoyed long conversations with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/visser.html&#34;&gt;Albert Visser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/moortgat.html&#34;&gt;Michael Moortgat&lt;/a&gt; and some of their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine&amp;rsquo;s promotion (she&amp;rsquo;s now an Assoc. Prof. &lt;em&gt;and Reader&lt;/em&gt;, woohoo!) and her research fellowship (she now has five years of only as much undergraduate teaching as she wants to do).  Super!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And non-academically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maddy Prior &amp;amp; the Carnival Band: On Tuesday night, we managed to get some babysitting so Christine and I could hear Maddy Prior &amp;amp; the Carnival Band&amp;rsquo;s Oxford Christmas concert.  (Have you ever heard shawms playing reggae?  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking the streets of Paris, and spending an afternoon at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musee-orsay.fr/&#34;&gt;Muse&amp;eacute; D&amp;rsquo;Orsay&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s something humbling about wandering through an art gallery and seeing a masterpiece at every second step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing Zachary thrive:  He&amp;rsquo;s had a great time at the day nursery at Wolfson, and despite a recent bout of sickness (a cold when I was away in Utrecht last week), he&amp;rsquo;s been doing really well.  Once he got used to the cold weather, he&amp;rsquo;s adapted nicely, though like us, he&amp;rsquo;s keen to get back to Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots more to say, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to let it digest and post more comments on my thoughts when I&amp;rsquo;ve got more regular internet access (i.e., I&amp;rsquo;m at home) and I&amp;rsquo;ve given the thoughts time to settle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve given my two talks here in St. Andrews, with really useful discussion in both of the talks.  In the philosophy talk, questions ranged from matters of meaning theory, metaphysics and epistemology of possibility and necessity. Thanks especially to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~dpn/&#34;&gt;Daniel Nolan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~csj6/&#34;&gt;Carrie Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~arche/pages/personal/rossbergpers.html&#34;&gt;Marcus Rossberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ole Thomassen Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/STAFF/wright.html&#34;&gt;Crispin Wright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt; and other people whose webpages I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the next day in my talk in computer science, I had a great discussion with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~rd/&#34;&gt;Roy Dyckhoff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~rr/&#34;&gt;Robert Rothenberg&lt;/a&gt; on converting the sequent system in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets&#34;&gt;my paper on S5&lt;/a&gt; into one with invertible rules, which can then be used as an implementation.  It seems to work.  (Photographic evidence is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/In%20Roy%20Dyckhoff&#39;s%20office,%20November%2016,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went to three other talks on truth and paradox, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/hartryfield&#34;&gt;Hartry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/academic/philosophy/gp.html&#34;&gt;Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly over-&lt;em&gt;paradoxed&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve got the morning to recover before we attempt to solve the problems of vagueness.  (This should be fun because I have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; settled opinion on matters of vagueness, so I&amp;rsquo;ll look at this more dispassionately, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be free to heckle from the back of the audience.)&lt;/p&gt;

This means I&amp;rsquo;ll miss the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessSeminar16Nov2005&#34;&gt;Vagueness Seminar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Dept/EventRegister&#34;&gt;Philosophy Departmental Colloquium&lt;/a&gt;.  However, I will be at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/ParadoxWorkshop&#34;&gt;Revenge Workshop&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://weka.ucdavis.edu/~ahwiki/bin/view/Arche/VaguenessWorkshop5&#34;&gt;Vagueness Workshop&lt;/a&gt; for Friday and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be enough to keep me going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 1</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/10/11/week_1/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re now in the second day of &amp;ldquo;week 1&amp;rdquo; of Michaelmas, here in Oxford, and the philosophy faculty library is &lt;em&gt;considerably&lt;/em&gt; busier than it was in week 0, let alone the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; weeks.  It&amp;rsquo;s just as well that I&amp;rsquo;ve got some writing done already.  Today I&amp;rsquo;m heading off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; to give two talks.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy&#34;&gt;Philosophy Department&lt;/a&gt; will get the first outing of my fresh-off-the-presses paper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;Invention is the Mother of Necessity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in which I try out a (new, I hope) semantically anti-realist account of metaphysical necessity and possibility.  Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/invention&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think, if you&amp;rsquo;re into that sort of thing.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting it also in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Philosophy/index.html&#34;&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sann1762/Jowett.html&#34;&gt;here in Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, so it will probably see signifiant modifications and updates over the next months.  The other talk is the formal partner of that one, on proof theory for S5.  I&amp;rsquo;m still writing the notes up for this (we&amp;rsquo;ll see how much I can get written on the train today), and I&amp;rsquo;ll upload that when I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, with these papers largely written, I can get back to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;!  I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cut elimination generalised</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This post is a change of scene for those of you that have come to expect &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/09/03/reflections_on_iona_part_1&#34;&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/09/05/reflections_on_iona_part_2&#34;&gt;meditations&lt;/a&gt; on matters personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to experiment with posting some of my work scribblings as an irregular record of thoughts I&amp;rsquo;m having while working on sabbatical.  It may well confirm the impression that you might have that I&amp;rsquo;m crazy, but hey, I have tenure, so I won&amp;rsquo;t worry about that too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of days I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about cut elimination arguments, and in particular, the general cut elimination argument that you can find in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; (look around &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=cut+elimination&amp;sig=lgHAlb56O39iT6gIVkimS7P_j8g&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It struck me last night &amp;ndash; as I was trying to find the right mix of generality and clarity &amp;ndash; that there&amp;rsquo;s nothing in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s original argument that &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; that formulas have just two distinct positions in a sequent (the traditional two positions are &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;consequent&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, or if you like, &lt;em&gt;premise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;conclusion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;input&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;output&lt;/em&gt;).  Every presentation of cut elimination that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of (even for single sided systems which don&amp;rsquo;t have an explicit left or right to a sequent) has two &amp;ldquo;positions&amp;rdquo; in which a formula can reside.  (In single sided systems this is represented by the dualising map on formulas).  The point is seen in the structure of the identity rule (an instance of the formula on each position, left and right, is what gives you an &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;) and the cut rule (take two sequents, one with the formula in &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; position, the other with it in &lt;em&gt;consequent&lt;/em&gt; position &amp;ndash; the &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; rule tells you how to combine them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as I was saying, it struck me last night (at approximately 1:30am &amp;ndash; I indulge myself by working late when my spouse is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ps.au.dk/showpage.asp?lPageID=34&#34;&gt;out of town&lt;/a&gt;) that the form of the traditional cut-elimination argument &amp;ndash; when you look at it in the right way, at least &amp;ndash; in no way requires that there are just two positions in a sequent.  You could have &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; if you like.  Or maybe &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;.  Or soemthing else entirely.  All you need is for identity and cut to interact in the right kind of way (cuts composed with identities disappear), for the rules to commute with cuts in parametric positions, and for cuts on principal formulas to be eliminable.  It works quite generally, which is very pretty.  (I have an example scrawled on pages of my notebook as I was taking a coffee after lunch this afternoon of a cut elimination theorem for a sequent system in which sequents have &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; different slots.  You can visualise proofs in this system as having input and output going from top to bottom on the page &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; different inputs and outputs going left-to-right.  In this picture, there are two kinds of cut: &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;vertical&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the question for you, gentle reader (if you have read this far, as you seem to have): Can you think of any reason why we would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; such a thing, beyond the insane desire to generalise well-known theorems and constructions?  Can you think of any applications in which you might want proof-like-objects to go in &amp;ldquo;more than one direction&amp;rdquo; in this sense, or analogously, in which you might have attitudes of more than just assertion and denial to propositional content and more importantly, have vocabulary that is sensitive to these different features?  I can think of &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=bilattice&#34;&gt;one possibility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections on Iona, part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the second part of my reflections on our week on Iona.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that kind of news, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; significant thing about our time on Iona &amp;ndash; the week was tempered by an event just before we left for the island.  The story started on the Friday before we left Edinburgh on Saturday.  It was my last day teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;ESSLLI&lt;/a&gt;, and I was having lunch with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/_insti/r04/fr/content0501.php&#34;&gt;Denis Bonnay&lt;/a&gt; and Benjamin Simmenauer, talking about logic, and the possibility of me visting Paris &amp;ndash; just before giving the last lecture of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/giveabs.php?40&#34;&gt;my course&lt;/a&gt;.  My phone rings.  Inside the restaurant there is terrible reception, but I can see that it&amp;rsquo;s Christine calling.  I apologise to Denis and Ben, and head out of the restaurant to hear Christine.  She&amp;rsquo;s upset.  She says &amp;ldquo;Zachary&amp;rsquo;s had an accident.  We&amp;rsquo;re in the hospital.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine sounds like I feel &amp;ndash; frantic and unsettled.  She explains that Zachary fell while running down a hill in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotland-flavour.co.uk/princes-street-gardens.html&#34;&gt;Princes Street Gardens&lt;/a&gt; in the centre of Edinburgh.  He split open his chin, there was a lot of blood, and after help from passers-by and a first aid officer from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natgalscot.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Scottish National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, they were in an ambulance to the children&amp;rsquo;s hospital.  It was not clear whether or not he&amp;rsquo;d need stitches, but there was a large and deep cut, lots of blood &amp;ndash; Christine said it looked like he had a second mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next call from the hospital came with news that Zachary was calm (when he saw the toys), Christine was happier, and the doctor decided that he didn&amp;rsquo;t need stitches.  &amp;ldquo;Steri-strips&amp;rdquo; patched his chin together, and the bleeding stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught my last class, in a rather distracted manner, keen to get home.  I caught the bus into Haymarket and the train home to see my son with a smile on his face and rather more bandages than he had ever worn before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that all of our time on Iona was punctuated with parental cries of &amp;ldquo;watch out for your chin!&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t run so fast, if you trip you&amp;rsquo;ll hurt your chin!&amp;rdquo; and other admonishments, and we kept worrying about whether or not we&amp;rsquo;d be able to keep him &lt;em&gt;clean&lt;/em&gt; enough to avoid any infection in the cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long and the short of it was that he has healed up pretty well.  He did end up with a very mild infection but a quick check with the doctor on Thursday helped us change the strips to new ones, keep the wound much more ventilated, and since then it&amp;rsquo;s healed up nicely into a single line across his chin, fading daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other significant events on Iona included our group art project, for the Thursday night communion service and Friday morning leaving service, and our conceptual art &amp;ldquo;installations&amp;rdquo; on Thursday afternoon.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you just a hint of what both activities involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stephenraw.com/&#34;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; explained that we were going to make a large banner of words, and that we would each paint a single &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt;.  We were given a colour pallette (green, red, brown, black, yellow), inspired by Africa, and we were choose a letter from a big list.  With some inspiration from lots of different examples of different fonts, we went off with a large rectangle of card, and ideas in our heads.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t know where our letter would feature in the banner, but we knew that it would be &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.  I chose one of the five &lt;em&gt;R*s, and Christine chose one of the four *C*s.  After much conversation and experimentation with technique, we finished our letters.  Steve and others then shuffled them around and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Assembling%20the%20banner,%20August%2025,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;assembled them&lt;/a&gt; into a nine by six banner of fifty-four different paintings to make one large artwork.  It scrubs up pretty well.  Christine&amp;rsquo;s *C&lt;/em&gt; is great, with a wonderful watercolour effect in the background. I&amp;rsquo;m not particularly fond of my &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt; but I am happy with the experience of painting it (it&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; since I did so much with a brush and paint that wasn&amp;rsquo;t applied monochromatically to a wall or a ceiling).  I was most happy with the effect once it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/The%20completed%20Banner,%20August%2025,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;hung in the Abbey&lt;/a&gt;.  You have a different relationship to an artwork when you have contributed one small recognisable part to the whole, which I suppose, was one of the ideas behind doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday&amp;rsquo;s artistic activity started at an odd place.  This time Christine didn&amp;rsquo;t take part because she went to the doctor with Zachary &amp;ndash; the doctor has a practice on Mull and she comes over to Iona once a week, on Thursday, for non-urgent consultations.  We were concerned because Zachary&amp;rsquo;s cut had bled the day before when we removed bandages.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but we wanted a doctor&amp;rsquo;s opinion.  The opinon was what we thought.  It was mildly infected and not healing as quickly as it should be, the steri-strips should be re-applied and the wound should be exposed to the air to dry out and heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the art, Steve asked us to start with the following activity: we were to pair up and each person was choose a sheet from a pile, at random.  The sheet had the face of a person.  No name, no detail, just a &lt;em&gt;face&lt;/em&gt;. In our pairs, we were to imagine a conversation between the two people.  Not a mundane conversation, but one in which one of the people expressed some kind of need. I was paired with Margaret, Steve&amp;rsquo;s spouse.  We had a young white harried male executive (at least, he had a furrowed brow, was in an office, was well dressed and groomed, and was on the telephone), and an older, European woman, heavily made up, not so well off, and looking wistfully into the middle distance.  We decided that they were mother and son, estranged after years of slowly going apart.  They hadn&amp;rsquo;t been in touch for a couple of years.  He&amp;rsquo;s embarrassed by her ways, and she&amp;rsquo;s missing him and doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand his world.  She calls, to tell him she has been diagonsed with a grave illness and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have long to live.  He does not know how to react, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to see her, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that she wants him merely to &lt;em&gt;be with&lt;/em&gt; her rather than to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; things.  While working through the conversation with Margaret, I&amp;rsquo;m affected me deeply because (as most of you know) my mother died nearly ten years ago, and Christine&amp;rsquo;s mum died five years ago. Roleplaying an imagined and imaginary conversation does not provoke imaginary emotions &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the art.  We act out the conversation in front of the group if we&amp;rsquo;re happy to do that &amp;ndash; Margaret and I were first to do it, and nearly everyone else was happy to do it too).  They were all equally touching and suprisingly varied and subtle. (The most fun was the two blokes doing the two elderly women, one &amp;lsquo;Anglo&amp;rsquo; and the other from the subcontinent.  That was unexpectedly touching and sweet.  They met at a doctors surgery and it was a meditation on what it was to have a home and a family.) While we acted out our conversation, the rest of the group were to note down significant &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; that they heard.  After it was all done, we looked at the words/phrases people noticed in the conversations and chose one that seemed to have some personal significance, and made it a part of an artwork.  Here, artwork was defined &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; broadly.  One of our number chose the phrase &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; and created a path up a hill near the centre with a length of wool, pausing halfway to spell &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; in wool and then leading on to the other side of the hill to stop.  At different stages through the day, different people followed the path and engaged with the artwork.  I chose the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; (the harried young man seemingly didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of it; the passing of time had seen the estrangement of mother and son; and I have a new relationship with time on this sabbatical) and knew almost immediately a part of what I wanted to do.  I wanted to deface all of the clocks in the centre, by cutting a strip of paper, emblazoned with the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;, over the face of the clock, not entirely obscuring the face, but confronting people with the word while they checked the clocks in their routine throughout the day.  This was a good start, but I wanted to do more.  In a community of over 50, you would think there would be many clocks but there were only three.  Christine suggested I get to work on watches.  So, I offered to replace everyone&amp;rsquo;s watch with a wristband (alas, I know, everyone is doing it these days &amp;ndash; my excuse is that this is a watch-substitute, not a sign of your allegience to an idea or a cause!) containing only the word &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;.  You could keep your watch but you mustn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;wear&lt;/em&gt; it for the rest of the day.  This was most enjoyable, appropriating people&amp;rsquo;s bodies for the artistic exercise.  (I know something of what advertisers must feel when they see people wearing their slogan on a T-shirt.)  It also gave me an opportunity to think in a different way about the passing of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday evening saw the communion service in the evening, and I was a part of a choir for that service, as I&amp;rsquo;d been a part of a &amp;ldquo;Wee Sing&amp;rdquo; earlier in the week, and I was a bass and we needed bass voices.  I also knew that this evening would see the first performance of a new song by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/?a=253&amp;amp;pr=78&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Tim Williams, the music director at Iona for the year.  Tim is a young man, taking a year off from his Ph.D. in music at Cambridge to direct the music (and to teach untaught singers to sound halfway decent in a group).   John&amp;rsquo;s new song (a Sanctus/Benedictus) is wonderful &amp;ndash; not too difficult to sing in four parts, with a memorable melody and interesting harmonic movement, and it was a buzz to be a part of its first outing in a group.  (The song was written on the Monday, and we were rehearsing on Wednesday to sing on Thursday.)  The &amp;ldquo;wall of sound&amp;rdquo; effect that a choir of 40 or so can achieve in the small Abbey is something to be heard to be believed. I would&amp;rsquo;ve kept the music were it not for the note indicating that the sheets were to be destroyed after the performance. To hear what it sounds like, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to either come to Iona sometime or wait for the next music publication from &lt;a href=&#34;http://ionabooks.com/&#34;&gt;Wild Goose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What remains with me from the week on Iona, already passing into memory as I&amp;rsquo;ve been here in Oxford for a over a week, settling in.  It&amp;rsquo;s a memory, but as we explored in various ways through the artwork and through living on the island with so much history, and participating in community traditions going back so many years, memories can be &lt;em&gt;expressed&lt;/em&gt;, they can be &lt;em&gt;articulated&lt;/em&gt; (to engage in some philosophical jargon for a minute). Words provide a powerful means of articulating memories, and when we use words in creative ways, we not only express static memories, we can also bring to light previously hidden or unnoticed features of what we have seen or heard or experienced.  Sometimes we need new forms, new words, or whole new &lt;em&gt;vocabularies&lt;/em&gt; to account for what is before us. I came to understand this in a new way in Iona, and that is something that will stay with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone with whom I shared that week, thankyou.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflections on Iona, part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is an extended post reflecting on the week in Iona.  Read on if you want to find out what we did for a week on a small Hebridean island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; straightforward to get to Iona, when you start from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.9eastbay.co.uk/&#34;&gt;our B&amp;amp;B in North Queensferry&lt;/a&gt;.  Our day&amp;rsquo;s journey started early with a taxi ride to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/EdinburghWaverley/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;Edinburgh Waverley&lt;/a&gt;, and then a train to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitscotland.com/library/glasgowqueenstreet&#34;&gt;Glasgow Queen Street&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused, as many people do, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Stations/stations/glasgowcentral/Default.aspx&#34;&gt;Glasgow Central&lt;/a&gt;, an altogether different train station in an altogether different place).  With our bags piled around us, we had a little while to collect supplies for the next train trip, and to play the game of &amp;ldquo;who else here is going to Iona.&amp;rdquo;  The late-middle-aged single American women with loud voices and Celtic crosses were very easy to spot.  As was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/?a=253&amp;amp;pr=78&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt; (we&amp;rsquo;d met him on one of his visits to Australia).  We were less sure of others, but it turned out that lots of people on the train were heading to retreat on Iona, like us.  The rest of the trip was a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/system/galleries/download/print_maps/uk.pdf&#34;&gt;long train journey west to Oban&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/summer-mull-timetable2.html&#34;&gt;ferry from Oban to Craignure&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/mull.html&#34;&gt;Mull&lt;/a&gt;, a bus across Mull to Fionnphort and then a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.calmac.co.uk/summer-iona-timetable.html&#34;&gt;ferry to Iona&lt;/a&gt;.  We got there in mid-afternoon, having left just after six in the morning.  That&amp;rsquo;s good going, considering the distance we travelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island itself is small and quiet, dark in the evenings (no streetlights) and filled with history.  It&amp;rsquo;s rugged, windswept, with noticeably variable weather, with skies as clear as a bell one day, and cloudy,  windy drizzly on the next.  (It was also a week of no internet connections, though I could have logged on to an internet terminal had I really wanted to.)  But the island is not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; far away from it all.  The outside world intrudes as are ferryloads of visitors disgorged onto the little island each day.  There are daytrippers, weeklong retreaters like us, and longer-term volunteers, workers on the community, and the residents.  Wherever you go, there the twenty-first century intrudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community sites on the island are the work of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk&#34;&gt;Iona Community&lt;/a&gt;, an ecumenical Christian community that runs two retreat centres on the island. The life in the community revolves around regular worship in the Abbey: 9am each day, afternoons and 9pm, and different &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk/abbey/isp1.htm&#34;&gt;programs&lt;/a&gt; are run each week on different themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iona.org.uk/mac/main.htm&#34;&gt;MacLeod Centre&lt;/a&gt;, which caters for families. We were a part of a group of around fifty, parents, kids, singles, old and young.    Our week involved exploring the visual arts, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stephenraw.com/&#34;&gt;Stephen Raw&lt;/a&gt;, who lead us in workshops which managed to teach us some of the finer points of lettering, artistic expression, interpersonal skills of empathy and interpretation, memory, creativity, the relationship between individuals and a larger community, and many other things besides.  Our artworks were to make a nametag in pencil for a partner (Sunday) the painting of a single &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt; (Monday), a painting of a single &lt;em&gt;letter&lt;/em&gt; (Wednesday) to contribute to a large artwork for use in the service on Thursday night and Friday morning, and an artistic &amp;ldquo;installation&amp;rdquo; (Thursday) concerning a word/concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word for Monday&amp;rsquo;s exercise was chosen on the basis of a conversation with a partner about what we had thought about coming to Iona.  We then had to paint the word, and when we went off on an excursion to the island of Staffa (and Fingal&amp;rsquo;s Cave), Stephen and other people staying at the centre had them put up in the dining room and other places around the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the process of painting the word &amp;ldquo;rest&amp;rdquo;. I chose some dark grey paper (with a slightly reflective surface) and dark blue, purple and black paints for the letters.  I wanted a grey wash over the word to complete the sleepy/restful effect.  We were painting with pretty strong acrylic paints, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious how to get the grey wash. I asked Judy, the craft worker at the centre, and she found some silver powder paint that looked like it had been unused for years.  I mixed it up in a very watery way, and it provided an interesting wash effect, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem quite what I wanted.  As we were talking about how to get just the right effect Stephen then came up with an idea &amp;ndash; why not take the painting (appoximately 1.5 metres square) on the boat trip to Staffa, and put it in the water there?  This would make the paint run, but it would make the wash run much more than the words, which were painted in acrylic.  The &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; would also be something to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we rolled up the painting (once it was dryish) and off on the boat we went.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.holidaymull.org/attractions/staffa.htm&#34;&gt;Staffa and Fingal&amp;rsquo;s cave&lt;/a&gt; were stunning (the island is a part of the same rock formation as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geographia.com/northern-ireland/ukiant01.htm&#34;&gt;Giant&amp;rsquo;s Causeway&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland, with distinctive hexagonal rock formations), and after walking through the cave (in which the sound of the sea is the most ringing memory), with canvas in hand I traipsed down to water&amp;rsquo;s edge (at a point where the drop was not too precipitous, and where I could see the Abbey on Iona on the horizon), unrolled the paper and let the sea have its way with it.  The &amp;ldquo;baptism&amp;rdquo; completed, we spread it out to dry off some of the water but we eventually had to go to explore some of the rest of the island.  So, we folded up the painting, and let it stew in a plastic bag while we climbed to the top of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when we got back (with a tired Zachary, and a slightly seasick Christine, as the boat&amp;rsquo;s return to Iona was on a rising swell) we unfolded it and saw the effect.  It was great!  The silvery grey had run and the water had left a distinctive feathery pattern, and I had a painting that not only expressed a thought but bears marks not only from its maker but also the place in which it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to say about Iona, but it&amp;rsquo;s already too late this afternoon. I&amp;rsquo;m off to do some grocery shopping and to cook dinner.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write more and post about the rest of the week when I&amp;rsquo;m on the net later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Phew!  We&amp;rsquo;re back in Oxford, and arrived in our house today.  We&amp;rsquo;re in a cute little 2 bedroom house in the northern outskirts of Oxford, a quick busride down Banbury Road into Wolfson or the centre of town.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently dealing with some of the backlog of email in a Starbucks (of all places!) with a wireless network.  The week at Iona was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write an extended post about it in a little while.  For now I have lots of other things to do to make the cute little house a bit more like a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;, and figuring out how to best use my worktime for the best mix of reading, writing, going to seminars, giving talks, etc., etc.  (That and figuring out how I&amp;rsquo;ll live without internet access at home.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Denmark, Oxford, Edinburgh…</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/08/18/denmark_oxford_edinburgh_/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Too many things are happening for me to spend &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time posting here until the whirl of activity settles down.  Still, people have been wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going on, so here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a run-down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Logic Colloquium, I went back to Denmark to rejoin the family, to have a holiday in Blokhus with close friends.  Much fun was had, involving sand dunes, beaches, rain, driving on the other side of the road, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Blokhus we trained to Copenhagen, where we all had more holiday, involving Tivoli (in the rain), Danish icecream, cathedrals, public transport, and a flash &lt;a href=&#34;http://danhostel.dk/vandrerhjem.asp?lan=uk&amp;amp;id=144&#34;&gt;designer hostel&lt;/a&gt;.  (Photographic evidence of some of this can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Copenhagen we flew to Heathrow (let me tell you, flying in to Heathrow from merely one timezone away is &lt;em&gt;qualitatively&lt;/em&gt; different from flying in from the antipodes) to catch a bus to Oxford, to spy out the land.  Unfortunately, spying out the land involved learning that our college had failed to find us accommodation for our stay, and that we were flung onto the open rental market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, a train to Edinburgh, where we&amp;rsquo;re staying in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.9eastbay.co.uk/&#34;&gt;B&amp;amp;B in North Queensferry&lt;/a&gt; with a wonderful host (thanks, Molly!) and a view over the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days involve train trips into Edinburgh (or Glasgow), enjoying the vibe of festival crowds, going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Tattoo&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night, and me teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/&#34;&gt;ESSLLI&lt;/a&gt;.  That&amp;rsquo;s been fun, but my mind has been elsewhere much of the time attempting to arrange accommodation for Oxford by the internet and by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully (and with much help from our Oxford friends, Steven and Emma) we have secured a little two-bedroom house up Banbury Road from our college.  So now we can enjoy the rest of our time in Edinburgh a little more, and we can &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; rest up and enjoy our retreat in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk&#34;&gt;Iona&lt;/a&gt; next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 4</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today is Day 4 of the colloquium.  Yesterday was a day of rest, which for me involved a visit to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.culture.gr/2/21/214/21404m/e21404m1.html&#34;&gt;Byzantine and Christian Museum&lt;/a&gt;, in the morning, a lazy afternoon restructuring the order things in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/giveabs.php?40&#34;&gt;ESSLLI course&lt;/a&gt; while staying in the shade, and visiting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/index.cfm?get=home&#34;&gt;Herakleidon Museum&lt;/a&gt; which featured an exhibit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/index.cfm?get=exhibits&amp;amp;show=current&amp;amp;ItemID=31&#34;&gt;Escher prints&lt;/a&gt; (the detail in some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.herakleidon-art.gr/detail.cfm?ItemID=31&amp;amp;PhotoID=116&amp;amp;get=exhibits&amp;amp;StartRow=25&#34;&gt;woodcuts&lt;/a&gt; was beyond belief), and then the obligatory visit to the Acroplolis as it got slightly cooler.  Photographic evidence is found &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam&#34;&gt;over there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today features lots of philosophical logic and proof theory.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post comments as we go, battery life and concentration permitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First up&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Sheard, on &amp;ldquo;A transactional approach to the logic of truth&amp;rdquo;.  The topic was theories of truth, involving consistent reductions of the class of &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; biconditionals &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; iff &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. The liar paradox causes problems, so Michael gave a nice overview of the kinds of consistent thoeries of truth that weaken the assumptions to restore consistency.  He argued for what he called a &amp;ldquo;transactional approach,&amp;rdquo; to thinking about the issue which &amp;ndash; sensibly, in my view &amp;ndash; focusses on why one might be interested in using the concept of truth, in communication between agents, and in evaluation of what those agents say. One nice thing  in the talk was that he gave a very nice overview of the kinds of problems afflicting different truth theories (such as &amp;omega;-inconsistency or non-conservativeness over the basic theory).  As I actually &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/minitrue/&#34;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; some of the theories which are prone to these phenomena, I need to think about this some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/&#34;&gt;Helmut Schwichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;.  He gave an overview of his work on minimal logic for representing computational content.  The idea is a straightforward one: it&amp;rsquo;s been long known that &amp;lambda; terms do a good job of encoding proofs in minimal implicational logic.  Other terms can be use to encode proof structure of conjunction, disjunction, quantifiers, etc.  Helmut has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://minlog-system.de/&#34;&gt;working on&lt;/a&gt; a system in which natural deduction in minimal logic can be used to represent proofs, and terms in the system encode proofs in a handy fashion, and these proofs encode &lt;em&gt;programs&lt;/em&gt;.  (The fact that classical proofs can be embedded in proofs in minimal logic means that even classical proofs can construct programs too.)  That much I was familiar with.  The new and interesting material for me was Helmut&amp;rsquo;s technique for associating each formula &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; with a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; &amp;tau;(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;), representing the &lt;em&gt;computational content&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  The idea is that atomic mathematical statements (identities between ground terms, for example) have no computational content, but that other logical constructions, such as existential or universal quantification &lt;em&gt;introduce&lt;/em&gt; computational content.  The idea then is that we keep track of computational content as we prove something, and the computational content gives us a handle on the upshot for computation of each statement.  I did not get all of the details, but a simple google search dug up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~minlog/minlog/mlcf.ps&#34;&gt;this very recent account of the technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~petera/&#34;&gt;Peter Aczel&lt;/a&gt;, on Constructive Set Theory.  This was the first of two introductory talks on constuctive set theory, and in particular the system CZF, of constructive ZF set theory, which differs from the other system of intuitionistic set theory IZF by avoiding impredicativity by having weak versions of the separation axiom, and in which the powerset axiom is avoided completely in favour of conditions which generate sets of &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding the powerset axiom important in non-classical set theories, because there are &lt;em&gt;very many&lt;/em&gt; subsets of very simple sets.  In particular, the singleton set 1 = {0} has very many subsets: it has one for each &lt;em&gt;truth value&lt;/em&gt;, so much so that the power &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; of the singleton, {x | x is a subset of 1}, which we can call &amp;Omega; may well be very &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;.  You can see this, because it is straightforward to prove, for any statement &amp;phi; that there is a set {x : x = 0 and &amp;phi;}, and then, this set is a subset of 1, and it contains 0 &lt;em&gt;to the degree to which &amp;phi; is true&lt;/em&gt;.  This is very cute, and it makes set theory on anything other than two-valued logic quite different and quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to work with sets of functions, rather than sets of subsets, because the set of functions from a set &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; to the two-element set {0,1} is much more manageable than the power class &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter also gave a nice sketch of the many different kinds of constructive mathematics there are, and showed how his own work in constructive set theory fits in.  His aim is to provide a set-theoretical vocabulary which is both motivated on the basis of a Martin-L&amp;ouml;f type theory, and extensional (hence the talk of &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt;) and applicable to the bulk of contemporary mathematics on the other.  It&amp;rsquo;s a laudable goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a pity that I won&amp;rsquo;t hear tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s class when Peter covers inductive and coinductive definitions (I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to hear that) and constructive topology.  I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll have to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ml.kva.se/preprints/meta/AczelMon_Sep_24_09_16_56.rdf.html&#34;&gt;this set of notes&lt;/a&gt; from 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; two talks I managed to get to were by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/~negri/&#34;&gt;Sara Negri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbg.ac.at/phs/people/leitgeb_e.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, they were a great way to end the conference.  In the special session on Philosophical Logic orgnaised by &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo Antonelli&lt;/a&gt;, they were interesting new developments on topics I&amp;rsquo;m actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;em&gt;Sara&lt;/em&gt;.  She presented a uniform way to add to G3c &amp;ndash; the nice sequent calculus for classical logic in which the structural rules for contraction and weakening are not explicit but are admissible &amp;ndash; labels and an explicit accessibility relation, in order to treat a whole host of normal modal logics, and for good measure, intermediate and substructural logics as well.  The different systems are given by different rules governing the accessibility relation, and the system has nice proof theoretical properties no matter what accessibility conditions you have. In other words, it has exactly the right kind of separation between connective rules on the one hand and generalised &amp;lsquo;structural&amp;rsquo; rules on the other. (If we admit the simple rules between statements of accessibility relation under the &amp;lsquo;structural&amp;rsquo; heading for a moment &amp;ndash; I have a reason for doing this, as you might see later.) The trickiest bit of the paper was the treatment of &lt;em&gt;provability&lt;/em&gt; logics, which have been hard to treat in proof calculi.  Sara manages to get sequent systems for &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; logics too, by changing the rules for necessity.  I&amp;rsquo;ll have to read the paper in detail to see how this works out.  Thankfully, the paper will be out in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Philosohpical Logic&lt;/em&gt; quite soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best for me is that I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I have a direct translation between the labelled sequent formulation that Sara uses and the non-labelled structural formulation of a calculus that I&amp;rsquo;m working on via proofnets.  It &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; very  natural when you see how it works.  I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out the details, but once I have something concrete, I&amp;rsquo;ll write it up and explain the translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;em&gt;Hannes&lt;/em&gt;.  His paper continued the theme of formal theories of truth started by Mike Sheard in his morning talk.  Hannes took &lt;em&gt;necessity&lt;/em&gt; and showed what you need to do to treat it as a predicate of sentences, in the same way that we treat truth.  Taking work from his very recent &lt;em&gt;JPL&lt;/em&gt; paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;amp;id=doi:10.1007/s10992-004-3758-3&#34;&gt;What Truth Depends On&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; he showed how to extend the consistent treatment of truth to one of necessity (or other normal modal operators).  This is not straightforward, since a well-known result due to Montague shows that liar-like paradoxes follow from the weak principles of necessity elimination (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;phi; &amp;rarr; &amp;phi;) and necessitation (if &amp;phi; is a provable, then so is &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&amp;phi;), given that you can form fixed point sentences like the liar.  (That&amp;rsquo;s the down-side between treating necessity as a predicate rather than an operator.  The upside is that you get such expressive power: by being able to treat necessity as a predicate you can quantify into the sentential place, and do lots of nice things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Hannes explained what you should do to recover some decent modal logic in the context in which necessity is treated as a predicate and not an operator.  The trick is to see that you do need to restrict the application of the offending rules (necessity elimination and necessitation) to a class of formulas.  In this case, Hannes has a nice explanation of what it is to be self-referential, and what it is to be ungrounded (and these clearly differ &amp;ndash; there can be ungrounded sentences that aren&amp;rsquo;t self referential &amp;ndash; this is discussed in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;amp;id=doi:10.1007/s10992-004-3758-3&#34;&gt;What Truth Depends On&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;).  Then, a nice preservation construction is used to show that you can model the operation of necessity on the &lt;em&gt;grounded&lt;/em&gt; sentences in such a way as to get any normal modal logic you want, restricted to grounded sentences. The construction is very nice, and Hannes gives an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; clear talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage of the proceedings, my brain had completely melted, so I went out and had a drink with &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo&lt;/a&gt;, and then we had dinner once the rest of the crew (including Hannes, Sara, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/%7Evonplato/&#34;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/&#34;&gt;Giovanna&lt;/a&gt;) finished the late session.  I managed to reduce my &lt;em&gt;Trotsky number&lt;/em&gt; (the length of the chain of the form &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; shook hands with &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; shook hands with &amp;hellip; shook hands with &lt;em&gt;Trotsky&lt;/em&gt;) down to three &lt;em&gt;via&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_van_Heijenoort&#34;&gt;Giovanna&lt;/a&gt;, who once shared an office with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_van_Heijenoort&#34;&gt;Jean van Heijenoort&lt;/a&gt;, so now my Trotsky number is lower than my Erd&amp;ouml;s number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for my conference blogging.  The conference continues for Day 5, but I&amp;rsquo;m flying off to rejoin family.  I&amp;rsquo;m passing the baton to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt; who has promised to blog some of Day 5&amp;rsquo;s proceedings.  Posts here will resume their usual infrequency, and I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy some break before the onslaught in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 3</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/07/30/logic_colloquium_2005_day_3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2005 16:20:50 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/07/30/logic_colloquium_2005_day_3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s another busy day with lots of things to learn.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my impressions so far, updated through the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:20&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/kolaitis/&#34;&gt;Phokion Kolaitis&lt;/a&gt; is giving his second lecture &amp;mdash; he&amp;rsquo;s good, and it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting to learn about &lt;em&gt;dichotomy&lt;/em&gt; theorems in CSPs.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.info.unicaen.fr/~zanutti/rechch/identif.htm&#34;&gt;Schaefer&amp;rsquo;s dichotomy results&lt;/a&gt; cast in terms of constraint satisfaction problems, are really interesting.  The idea is that we can think of a class of constraints as expressed as the problem of whether or not there&amp;rsquo;s a homomorphism betwen your structure and another one (which is thought of as expressing the constraints).  So, 3-colourability might be expressed as the existence or nonexistence of a homomorphism between your graph and the complete graph K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  If there is such a homomorphism, your graph is 3-colourable, if there isn&amp;rsquo;t, your graph &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.   Phokion&amp;rsquo;s talk yesterday explained why CSPs can be expressed as homomorphism existence fact.  The idea is that conjunctive queries (predicate logic expressions using existential quantification and conjunction only) have exactly the right kind of preservation properties to express these homomorphism existence facts on relational structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Schaefer&amp;rsquo;s result is that the problem of whether or not (for a given boolean algebra &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;), the issue of whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ve got a homomorphism from your structure into &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, is either solvable in polynomial time (like 2-colourability) or is NP-complete (like 3-colourability &amp;ndash; K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t a boolean algebra, but 3-colourability apparently can be expressed as CSP(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) for some boolean algebra).  This is nice.  Even if P isn&amp;rsquo;t NP, CSP(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is not in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phokion is now explaining Feder &amp;amp; Vardi&amp;rsquo;s conjecture that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; structure &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; has this dichotomy &amp;mdash; not only boolean algebras. There are some nice results approaching this.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/andrei.bulatov&#34;&gt;Andrei Bulatov&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/andrei.bulatov/FOCS02.ps&#34;&gt;showed that&lt;/a&gt; the conjecture works for structures of size up to &lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;.  So, there&amp;rsquo;s only 4,5,6,&amp;hellip; to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:30&lt;/em&gt;: Now some impressionistic comments on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/haskell/&#34;&gt;Deirdre Haskell&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talk on &amp;lsquo;Independence types in algebraically closed valued fields&amp;rsquo;.  This was a model theory talk, and I&amp;rsquo;m not a mathematical model theorist, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow everything by any means.  Deirdre is exploring how independence results from the analysis of &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; theories cross over to &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; theories, and in particular, valued fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in the program started by &lt;a href=&#34;http://shelah.logic.at/&#34;&gt;Shelah&lt;/a&gt;: we&amp;rsquo;re interested in the number, I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) of models cardinality &amp;lambda; of a first-order theory &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.  What can I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) be?  Given an &lt;em&gt;unstable&lt;/em&gt; theory (typically, that&amp;rsquo;s a theory with a linear ordering or something like it, such as a valuation function onto a linear ordering), I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) is 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is as big as it can be.  (Theories with orderings, such as the theory of rationals, are unstable, so are theories with orderings on a definable subset &amp;ndash; such as theories with &lt;em&gt;valuations&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, an anyone recommend the best introduction to stability in the model theoretic sense?  Should I just read Shelah&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://shelah.logic.at/short000.html&#34;&gt;initial paper on the topic&lt;/a&gt;?  I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it now, so I can&amp;rsquo;t tell what it&amp;rsquo;s like.  Hodges&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modeltheory-fo/&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia entry&lt;/a&gt; is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch my itch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if the theory we&amp;rsquo;re interested in is &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt;, then we don&amp;rsquo;t have as much information about this.  And hence, &lt;em&gt;stability&lt;/em&gt; theory.  (This talk was the clearest explanation of stability theory I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hearing).  Stable theories are algebraically closed fields, differentiably closed fields, etc.   The notion of forking (or non-forking), in pure model theories is important for studying stable theories, and in this case &amp;ndash; in classification theory &amp;ndash; model theorists exclusively studied stable theories since the problem of finding I(&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;lambda;) was solved for unstable &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.  But we&amp;rsquo;re interested in unstable &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; for other reasons.  Now people (like Deirdre Haskell) are using the tools from the study of stable theories in work on unstable theories.  She talked about the application of independence notions in the study of algebraically closed fields (they&amp;rsquo;re fields in which polynomials have solutions) with valuations.  A valuation is a map &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; from the field to some ordered group with an infinite element &amp;infin; added, where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;ab&lt;/em&gt;) = &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;+&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) = min(&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(a),&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(b))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(0) = &amp;infin;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; measures a kind of size (backwards!) and it gives the field a kind of stratification (and, for extra fun, a topology).  It also induces enough of an ordering on the field to make the theory unstable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, algebraically closed valued fields (AVCFs to their friends) are neat, because they are often (always? I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch how this worked in general) characterised by their maximal ideal (the elements &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; 0) and their residue field (the quotient of the AVCF with the maximal ideal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is generated by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_series&#34;&gt;Formal Laurent series&lt;/a&gt; over a field F in some term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.  These are power series, each going from index -&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; to infinity (you go negative to get inverses), and you let the valuation measure of a series to be its choce for -&lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt;, the first degree for which its coefficient is non-zero.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be negative.  (So, only finitely many of the negative degree coefficients are zero, but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have all of the positive coefficients non-zero.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In fact, this is just a valued field, not an algebraically closed one, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have roots of the term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;.  To fix this it&amp;rsquo;s enough to consider power series in each term &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1/&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for any &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, so-called &lt;a href=&#34;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/FractionalPowerSeries.html&#34;&gt;Puiseux series&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The super-neat &lt;em&gt;aha&lt;/em&gt; moment for me was when Deirdre drew the power series as a path in a tree.  The idea is that you list the exponents one at a time, and at each index, you have a branch for each element of the coefficient field.  (Lovely!  A talk with pictures!  It&amp;rsquo;s a pity that I won&amp;rsquo;t draw one for you here if for some weird reason you&amp;rsquo;ve read this far.)  That insight (simple enough that it is) was worth the price of admission alone for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first-order theory of AVCFs can be axiomatised with a predicate for the relation &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;), and an axiom scheme for being algebraically closed.  Deirdre then explained the definable sets (which turn out to be boolean combinations of open and closed &lt;em&gt;balls&lt;/em&gt; in the underlying topology), and then she got to work defining different notions of independence in these critters.  It turned out to be quite pretty, because in this case, even though the structure wasn&amp;rsquo;t stable, it seemed to have &amp;lsquo;enough&amp;rsquo; stability to get nice notions out.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got to the limit of my understanding, so if you&amp;rsquo;ve heroically read this far, I&amp;rsquo;ll point you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/%7Ehaskell/revisedACVF1.pdf&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/%7Ehaskell/ACVF-independence.pdf&#34;&gt;preprints&lt;/a&gt; on this material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I notice that I&amp;rsquo;ve come out sounding a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; like a mathematician here, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one.  You might wonder why a philosophical logician like me gets excited by talks like this outside my field.  It&amp;rsquo;s simple.  I like understanding things, and proving things, and seeing new constructions and ways of representing things.  Being stretched out of my own zone of familiarity and experience really does help. That&amp;rsquo;s what makes conferences like this neat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later today, my second talk, and also a series of contributed papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much later&lt;/em&gt;: OK, I&amp;rsquo;ve survived giving my talk.  (I even finished with time for questions and discussion in the timeslot, without being too rushed at the end.)  Discussion with people afterwards was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had good, constructive, feedback from &lt;a href=&#34;http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/&#34;&gt;Melvin Fitting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/&#34;&gt;Helmut Schwichtenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.helsinki.fi/~negri/&#34;&gt;Sara Negri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~neil/&#34;&gt;Neil Leslie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.unibo.it/~corsi/&#34;&gt;Giovanna Corsi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sbg.ac.at/phs/people/leitgeb_e.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;, and someone else whose name I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch but who asked a really perceptive question about the actual world in my proof circuits for S5.  (I must catch up with him to properly acknowledge him.)  Thanks, everyone!  There are obviously more people I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk to (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, where did you get to?) but time today seemed to run out.  I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve got to use Monday wisely, as I&amp;rsquo;m not at the conference on Tuesday &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve got to fly back out to rejoin my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I managed to get lots of ideas about how to improve the material, pointers to similar work done before, and possibilities for future investigation.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve got any thoughts about the material, feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;add them to the wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon&amp;rsquo;s contributed sessions, I got to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~til/staff/stouppa.html&#34;&gt;Phiniki Stouppa&lt;/a&gt; present her material on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linearity.org/cas/phiniki/phiniki04sbm.pdf&#34;&gt;Calculus of Structures for S5&lt;/a&gt;.  That was really nice to see: especially to see how she compared the CoS treatment of S5 with other treatments like Display Logic.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to explain in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt; how my circuits for S5 relates to display logic, but I obviously come down on the side of dispaly logic as making sense here, and I take the display calculus &amp;lsquo;connectives&amp;rsquo; to ways (complicated as they may be) to talk about these circuits.  The other (hyper-)sequent system for S5 that comes out of the circuits is in one sense a &amp;lsquo;reduction&amp;rsquo; of the display sequent calculus in which display equivalent sequents are identified.  (Anyway, I need to write all of that up before I say too much more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, two of the other contributed talks I wanted to go to were cancelled because the speakers didn&amp;rsquo;t show up.   Nonetheless, I got to hear a nice talk by Dimeter Vakarelov on modal correspondence theory (the topic of when it is that a modal formula &lt;em&gt;corresponds to&lt;/em&gt; a first order condition on a modal frame).  He has a nice technique of getting more than the usual Sahlqvist formulas (a syntactically characterised class of formulas) by means of an algorithm instead of a simple description of the syntax.  The idea is that the class of formulas is decided by an algorithm (turn the handle, do this, if it succeeds you have a first order correspondent, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t, well, you don&amp;rsquo;t).  This paper was a generalisation of some earlier work by Vakarelov and Conradie and Goranko &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aiml.net/volumes/volume5/Goranko.ps&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;, in which the class of formulas is &lt;em&gt;even bigger&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s the state of the art in correspondence theory.  (A nice short overview of correspondence theory is in &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/SL-stanford.pdf&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan&#34;&gt;Johan van Benthem&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; correspondence theory in the 1970s.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it from me.  Tomorrow is a break day (when I&amp;rsquo;ll explore some of the city), and I&amp;rsquo;ll resume posting conference information on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9:25&lt;/em&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s wireless access in the large lecture theatre, so I&amp;rsquo;ll take notes and upload comments occassionally through the day.  At the moment, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/kolaitis/&#34;&gt;Phokion Kolaitis&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/phonecam/Phokion%20Kolaitis%20giving%20his%20CSP%20Course,%20Logic%20Colloquium,%20July%2029,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;giving his first short course lecture&lt;/a&gt; on constraint satisfaction problems.  So far he&amp;rsquo;s talking about examples of CSPs (graph colourings and 3-SAT are his first examples) and he&amp;rsquo;s just looking now at homomorphisms of relational structures, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/&#34;&gt;Feder&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/&#34;&gt;Vardi&lt;/a&gt; claim (&lt;a href=&#34;http://theory.stanford.edu/~tomas/constraint.ps&#34;&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;) that CSPs may be idenified with (or may be represented by) the problem of whether or not there&amp;rsquo;s a homomorphism between two relational structures.  (This bit is new to me, so I&amp;rsquo;ll listen closely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11:20&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://mmfd.nsu.ru/mmf/persons/gonch.htm&#34;&gt;Sergey Goncharov&lt;/a&gt; giving an invited lecture on &amp;lsquo;Isomorphisms and Definable Relations on Computable Models&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s always struck me as &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; that infinite ordinals have something to do with the characterisation of computable structures (where being computable is an essentially finitary notion in one sense &amp;ndash; any computation process can be finitely described), but then, ordinal notations are finite too.  Sergey&amp;rsquo;s talk is about constucting interesting structures (boolean algebras, rings etc.) that are computable, but have the Scott Rank of &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;CK&lt;/sup&gt; (that&amp;rsquo;s big).  This generalises some earlier results of Makkai (who showed that there were arithmetical structures of that rank) and Knight and Sheard (who showed that there were &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt; structures with that high a rank).  Goncharov&amp;rsquo;s results (proved by coding structures inside other structures) show how to construct familiar structures that are this complex.  A related recent preprint is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nd.edu/~wcalvert/preprints/moreo1ck.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:13&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.wisc.edu/~pezz/&#34;&gt;Itay Ben-Yaacov&lt;/a&gt; is on now, with the first of two classes on model theory in positive and continuous logics.  (His is the first presentation using &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; the slides look very nice indeed.  I can&amp;rsquo;t find the slides online, but an introductory paper on the same topic was recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1101/1101-002.ps&#34;&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Bulletin of Symbolic Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and so can be downloaded. (Thanks, &lt;em&gt;BSL&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Itaj&amp;rsquo;s work is interesting, because seeing odd logics motivated by mathematical considerations.  In this case, he&amp;rsquo;s interested in &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; logics (he likes to do without Boolean negation).  The idea is that in certain known model constructions (adding so-called &amp;lsquo;imaginary&amp;rsquo; elements to a model), the entire first-order theory of the original model is true in the extension.  This &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; work with the addition of &amp;lsquo;hyperimaginaries&amp;rsquo;. (While imaginaries are  classes of tuples (modulo a definable equivalence relation on the original model &amp;ndash; think of imaginary numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of reals), hyperimaginaries are definable classes of &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; tuples.)  Looking at what is preserved in model extension with hyperimaginaries, it turns out that you want to avoid Boolean negation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to be much more finely controlled results than the kinds of preservation under completely &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; extension discussed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://logicandlanguage.net&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and me &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/barriers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  There must be interesting results involved in classifying what kinds of statements are preserved in what kinds of expansions of models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15:15&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; in 15 minutes.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much, much later&lt;/em&gt;: OK, the live-blogging has ceased with me giving my talk, talking to people afterwards, and then going to the contributed talks in the later afternoon in the rooms where there&amp;rsquo;s no WiFi.  Presumably the heavy day, early mornings, late nights and being drained after giving my talk partially explain why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly good at concentrating during the all-to-short contributed talks in the afternoon.  There were some nice highlights however.  I caught up with some interesting material on fixpoint quantifiers and bisimulation quantifiers in modal logics (in a talk by Giacomo Lenzi), and in Dumitru Busneag&amp;rsquo;s talk, I was introduced to some nice algebra: the notion of a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; filter in a lattice ordered non-commutative doubly residuated algebra.  It&amp;rsquo;s a filter of which left implication is a member iff the corresponding right implication is a member.  Then for any normal filter &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; and an element &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is the set of all &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; where &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; is in &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is defined similarly) just like with normal subgroups.  That&amp;rsquo;s kind-of nice.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if these filters will play quite as &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; of an important role in these algebras as normal subgroups pay in group theory, but it&amp;rsquo;s pleasing to see the parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I need sleep.  I won&amp;rsquo;t be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as keen tomorrow in the long day sessions, as I plan to be conscious in more of the contributed sessions in the later afteroon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logic Colloquium 2005 Day 1</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/07/29/logic_colloquium_2005_day_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2005 07:23:56 &#43;1100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try this conference blogging thing, to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uoa.gr/lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium&lt;/a&gt; has started, with the opening address by Charles Parsons from Harvard.  His talk was on Paul Bernay&amp;rsquo;s later philosophy of mathematics &amp;mdash; a subject of which I knew &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.  So I learned a bit.  After Bernays&amp;rsquo; collaboration with Hilbert at G&amp;ouml;ttingen, he left Germany because of Nazi persecution, and spent the rest of his working life in Switzerland.  His philosophy of mathematics (according to Parsons) post war is characterised by his response to G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s results and the failure of Hilbert&amp;rsquo;s program.  For Bernays, mathematical truth is not necessarily &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; in any strong sense &amp;ndash; mathematical claims are verified in the competition of different conflicting mathematical theories, in just the same way that scientific theories are verified in competition with other theories.  The category of the &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; is relativised into the weaker catergory of the &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt;.  There are always beliefs or theories antecedent to our views, which may be examined, clarified and accepted and rejected.  But nothing makes those especially immune from criticism or revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound like a Quinean holism, but it&amp;rsquo;s not.  It is motivated by a kind of neo Kantianism, and Bernays shares none of Quine&amp;rsquo;s empiricism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of Parsons&amp;rsquo; points was that Bernays had a distinctive kind of platonist structuralism, akin in one sense to Carnap&amp;rsquo;s view of mathematical truth. He had a similar distinction between internal and external questions &amp;ndash; the theory itself tells us that there &lt;em&gt;exists&lt;/em&gt; a prime between 15 and 19, at it tells us that 17 is prime &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s all there is to exsitence, from the point of view of inside the theory.  It makes no sense to ask that quesiton &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made Bernays&amp;rsquo; platonism distinctive, according to Parsons, was that he thought that you could have &lt;em&gt;degrees&lt;/em&gt; of platonic existence for mathematical objects.  There was more or less objective existence depending on different criteria.  This reminds me of the Crispin Wright material on the degree to which a discourse might be apt for objective truth (cognitive command, wide cosmological role etc.), so I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s any connection there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Parsons pointed to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/bernays/&#34;&gt;Bernays Project&lt;/a&gt; to translate his works into English.  A lot of the material is available online, so you can have at it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk there was a concert, and a reception.  At the latter I was able to catch up with people that I&amp;rsquo;ve corresponded with, like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.let.uu.nl/~ctl/docenten/visser.html&#34;&gt;Albert Visser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard Zach&lt;/a&gt;.  Such nice people being around means that this should be a fun conference. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time for some sleep before tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s activity.  I need to be awake for &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;at least one class&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Legroom</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/07/28/legroom/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Remind me to check legroom on airlines before I book them for the first time &amp;ndash; especially if I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write on the plane.  Maersk Airlines has an interesting policy of offering seats in S/M/L sizes.  S seats have a tight pitch of 29 inches (73-and-a-bit centimetres).  You can upgrade to a roomier seet for a price&amp;ndash;a fact that the stewards make clear repeatedly on the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pleased that I got a seat in an otherwise empty row of three in an otherwise packed cabin. Another person asked to move into one of them, and between us, we had the middle seat to stretch our legs just a little and open my laptop.  (This is also the one occasion in which a 12inch Powerbook has a distinct advantage over my 17inch model.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Athens tomorrow.  Tonight I catch the train to K&amp;oslash;benhavn, where I stay overnight in a cheap hotel near the airport, to get my 7:30am flight. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uoa.gr/lc2005&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt; looks like it will be lots of fun.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy writing slides, and I should use the time on the train to put the finishing touches on Day 2. Once they&amp;rsquo;re done, I&amp;rsquo;ll post them on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re coming to Athens, feel free to post things up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/LC2005&#34;&gt;that wiki page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with a map using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plazes.com&#34;&gt;plazes&lt;/a&gt;, a neat little doodad that keeps track of where you are when you use a computer to access the net (if you explicitly log in yourself&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not spying on you without your consent).  It powers the map on the main page here, and you can use it to generate a map of where you&amp;rsquo;ve been.  Read on if you want to see our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the map:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re settled in &amp;Aring;rhus now, while Christine does work with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ps.au.dk/showpage.asp?lNobuffer=1&amp;amp;lPageID=86&#34;&gt;colleague&lt;/a&gt; on a research project.  This gives Z and me lots of time for lots of fun.  Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s fun was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;Legoland&lt;/a&gt; (Vibeke and Christine wanted to come too, so we all made a day of it).  Z loved the rides, and the displays, and the Lego for sale.  We bought a &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.lego.com/RetiredProducts.asp?p=4402&#34;&gt;set&lt;/a&gt; for him to grow into.  There&amp;rsquo;s lots of fiddly pieces, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already managed to make &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Zachary%20and%20a%20Lego%20creation,%20July%2019,%202005.jpg&#34;&gt;one of the models&lt;/a&gt; together. (He does the putting together and I help find the pieces for him.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to cook some dinner now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We fly later today!  The big study leave adventure starts later this afternoon.  The first few weeks alternate holidays and work for Christine and for me, and it gives us lots of time to enjoy the company of our young son.  Zachary and I are especially looking forward to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;Legoland in Billund&lt;/a&gt; and exploring the surrounds of &amp;Aring;rhus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our apartment apparently has an internet connection (I have no idea what kind, as of yet) so I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be able to post photos and comments here to keep you up to date from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes music is best heard &lt;em&gt;at volume&lt;/em&gt;.  A case in point?  The second movement of Shostakovich&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;String Quartet No. 8&lt;/em&gt;.  I recommend the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000042HV/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Fitzwilliam String Quartet recording&lt;/a&gt;.  (The Emerson Quartet&amp;rsquo;s recording is &lt;a href=&#34;http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=7300788&amp;amp;selectedItemId=7300697&#34;&gt;available on iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, but the Fitzwilliams&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Apologies to our next door neighbours.  I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my last bout of loud music at home before we travel and don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/05/08/nad_c521bee/&#34;&gt;decent sound system&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;Australasian Journal of Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is firing on all cylinders again.  As the managing editor, there was a period in this last semester where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t managing very well, and things piled up and got the better of me for quite some time. To speak overly frankly for a moment, I got &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; depressed over the state that things were in and over my own disorganisation. Unfortunately, being depressed is not a good condition in which to be motivated to do anything about that which you&amp;rsquo;re depressed about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a few solid days of working at it, sending things off, writing reports, collating information, copy-editing, typesetting, emailing, coding HTML, uploading, etc., I have something to show for it.  And I&amp;rsquo;m feeling much better about it all, too.  So, without further ado: Here&amp;rsquo;s the start of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/2005&#34;&gt;Volume 3: 2005&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud of it.  Thanks to the authors, and to my referees and readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently eighteen other papers in various stages of the submission pipeline, so you should expect us to be much more productive over the last half of 2005, when compared to the first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On applescript and php, and an archive page</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/06/26/on_applescript_and_php_and_an_archive_page/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2005 20:24:30 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/06/26/on_applescript_and_php_and_an_archive_page/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A half hour of php hacking has finally produced a working &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;archive page&lt;/a&gt; for the photos I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting from my phonecam.  My little Sony Ericsson T630 phone has a terribly lo-res camera, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to take shots now and then when you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally take photos.  Now, instead of sliding off the front page when I upload another one, you can see the old photos &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;on the archive page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes the thing fun is that the process of uploading them is so easy.  The camera has a bluetooth connection to the computer, so I can get photos from the camera while the camera is still in my pocket.  (That&amp;rsquo;s easy.)  Then I drag a photo to an icon on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/pro/training/macosx_basics/segment102663b.html&#34;&gt;dock on my computer&lt;/a&gt; and the little applescript I wrote pops up a dialogue box to enter a title, and the thing scales the image (the camera takes pictures at 288x352 and I scale them to 180x220 to fit in the sidebar) and uploads the result to the &lt;a href=&#34;phonecam&#34;&gt;/phonecam directory&lt;/a&gt; on consequently.org.  The next bit of magic is two php scripts.  One on the main page takes the latest jpg file out of the /phonecam directory and puts it in the right sidebar.  (The title is the filename with &amp;ldquo;.jpg&amp;rdquo; stripped out.)  The other is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/phonecam&#34;&gt;phonecam&lt;/a&gt; page, which uses more php to read the entries in last-to-first order, insert month headers for every new month, and put them on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if anything looks weird from your end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/06/24/logic_colloquium_2005_and_esslli_2005/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m teaching some classes on proof theory at &lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;ESSLLI 2005&lt;/a&gt; soon.  Spurred on a little bit by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antimeta.org/blog/archives/2005/05/few.html&#34;&gt;discussion of commentary at conferences&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered a little bit about how I can get interesting feedback going during/after the presentations.  (The material I&amp;rsquo;ll be teaching is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;Work very-much-in Progress&lt;/em&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;m keen to get feedback on how it comes across.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;ll point everyone to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Proof_and_Counterexample&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and set up spaces for people to write comments after the talk.  (That&amp;rsquo;s a given.)  But I&amp;rsquo;m sure that lots of people will have wireless-equipped laptops on the scene when I&amp;rsquo;m there.  Wikis aren&amp;rsquo;t the best for group communication in real-time, or joint simultaneous writing/editing of a document.  It strikes me now (after only thinking about it for a teensy bit) that I could host a document in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/&#34;&gt;SubEthaEdit&lt;/a&gt; for all of the mac users to take notes together.  That&amp;rsquo;s fine for collaborative notetaking.  People could use that as a way to take notes, write up questions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re coming to LC2005 or to ESSLLI2005, do you think that would be useful? If so, bring your computer along! Do you have anything else to recommend?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Flight of the Balloon</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/06/13/the_flight_of_the_balloon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2005 10:28:55 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/06/13/the_flight_of_the_balloon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This Queen&amp;rsquo;s birthday holiday moning, cool and clear, was a perfect time for Zachary and me to fly our hot-air balloon.  The flight was short but glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/up1.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying a balloon like this is not completely straightforward.  You need to unfurl the balloon carefully, and make sure no bit touches the little burner on the ground (fuelled with cotton wool soaked in Methylated Spirits).  Zachary held the balloon carefully like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/prep.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the building in the background.  We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a park in Brunswick, and the air is still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balloon inflated quite rapidly.  I held the base steady, and Zachary held the top, letting go when it was obvious that the air was warm enough to keep the balloon inflated. The air inside warmed very quickly:  We let go, and it was away &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/launch.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gained altitude remarkably quickly.  (It was tricky to get the shots I did with the camera while we figured out which way it was going.)  The wind picked up and it drifted westwards as it gained height:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/up2.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got further west than we expected, given the still air at ground level.  Notice the building it&amp;rsquo;s near.   It made a gentle landing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/balloon/landing.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the roof of the factory of &amp;ldquo;Valve Tech Engineering.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we learned another lesson in the transitory nature of all things.  &lt;em&gt;All flesh is grass, and all beauty is like the flower of the field.  The grass withers, the flower fades &amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Next travel thing: I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://skype.com&#34;&gt;skype.com&lt;/a&gt; and I have an account to make super-cheap voice calls home and almost anywhere else from the computer while overseas at least, when I&amp;rsquo;m connected to the internet.  It looks very well executed.  There are clients for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux, and at 1.7 euro cents a minute for calls to any landline (it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more expensive to call mobiles) in Western Europe, North America and Aus/NZ, it is a very good deal.  Then there&amp;rsquo;s the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s free if you&amp;rsquo;re making a Skype-to-Skype call.  If I were a &lt;a href=&#34;http://telstra.com&#34;&gt;telecommunications company making money from traditional telephony&lt;/a&gt;, I think I&amp;rsquo;d be worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a Skype account, let me know.  Look me up in the Skype directory to get my username.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taught my last classes for 2005.  I&amp;rsquo;m officially on study leave from July 1, until December 31.  We&amp;rsquo;re off on our journey from July 13.  First, Denmark, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking after Z, while Christine works with a colleague.  (Z and I plan to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lego.com/legoland/billund/&#34;&gt;have some fun&lt;/a&gt; in our time there.)  Then I&amp;rsquo;m off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt;, in Athens, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESSLLI2005&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh, and a week&amp;rsquo;s retreat on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk/&#34;&gt;the island of Iona&lt;/a&gt;, before heading down to Oxford, where we&amp;rsquo;ll both be Visiting Scholars at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iona.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Wolfson&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can keep track of our travels in the &amp;ldquo;Events&amp;rdquo; sidebar on this site.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very exciting, but there&amp;rsquo;s heaps to do, and if I need advice on travel, I&amp;rsquo;ll post questions here.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m visiting the U.K. and Europe for six months, and I&amp;rsquo;ll want to use a mobile.  Should I buy a prepaid sim card for my (triband) phone that I&amp;rsquo;ll be bringing with me?  What should I do if I wanted to use my phone through Europe without paying too much in roaming fees?   Keep in mind that I&amp;rsquo;ll be arriving first on the continent, and then going the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice?  If you do, post in the comments on this entry.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us/tag/tiger&#34;&gt;almost everyone else&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve installed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; very good upgrade to the operating system.  The system-wide search will be really handy.  It&amp;rsquo;s indexed all of my documents (which includes a 2.3GB library of PDF files of other people&amp;rsquo;s papers), so being able to find the 29 papers that mention &lt;em&gt;hypersequents&lt;/em&gt; (together with the 18 emails in my mail client) is just something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/pictures/spot.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;328&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having even more fun, however, with organising my files using tagging.  I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that one later.&lt;/p&gt;

Given Charles Pigden&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/history.html#10&#34;&gt;delightful account of seminars at Otago&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think that Google&amp;rsquo;s new &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com&#34;&gt;search-inside-the-book&lt;/a&gt; service will prove to be quite handy to a researcher like me.  It&amp;rsquo;s not satisfactory to read through a book like that on the screen (especially when copyright restrictions do not permit you to keep going after a couple of pages of continuous reading), but it will be a boon to research to be able to search inside the &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;  for &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com/print?q=lattice&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;id=8u-IU3xTHrcC&#34;&gt;everywhere lattices are mentioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea so much I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a &lt;a title=&#34;consequently.org/edit: Logic Books at print.google.com&#34; href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/Logic_Books_at_print.google.com&#34;&gt;list of logic-related books&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page&#34;&gt;my wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  Feel free to browse the list, and to add to it any other logic-related works you find on &lt;a href=&#34;http://print.google.com&#34;&gt;print.google.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>University Library Proxy Bookmarklet</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2005 21:02:43 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you do research on the web, and you browse around different sites for journals, seeing what&amp;rsquo;s been published, and what you should read.  Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; has online subscriptions for lots of these journals, so I can download the papers, file them, read them, etc.  It&amp;rsquo;s all very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to get from the site to actually download the paper.  Recently, our university introduced a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;proxy server&lt;/a&gt; as the means to keep track of whether someone attempting to download material under the banner of a University of Melbourne subscription is actually authorised to do so (i. e., is a member of staff or a student).  So, if I&amp;rsquo;m at a page for a journal like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mind.oupjournals.org/current.dtl&#34;&gt;http://mind.oupjournals.org/current.dtl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and I want to download a paper like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mind.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/114/453/1&#34;&gt;http://mind.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/&lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;453&lt;/sub&gt;/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to manually edit the address, by sticking &amp;ldquo;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&amp;rdquo; at the end of the hostname, before the path. (Between &amp;ldquo;.org&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;/cgi&amp;rdquo; here).  I am &lt;em&gt;lazy&lt;/em&gt; and I don&amp;rsquo;t like having to type &amp;ldquo;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&amp;rdquo; time and again when browsing the journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I use a little link I made &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(location.href=&#39;http://&#39;+location.host+&#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;+location.pathname+location.search)&#34;&gt;+mate.lib&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; in the bookmarks bar of my browser, and whenever I&amp;rsquo;m on a site, it takes me directly to the relevant page viewed through proxy site, and I can download at will.  The bookmark is a simple bit of javascript:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;javascript:void(location.href = 
      &#39;http://&#39; + location.host 
      + &#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;
      + location.pathname
      + location.search)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it works like a charm.  One click, and you&amp;rsquo;re there.  Feel free to utilise a version of this yorself if &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usefulutilities.com/support/institutions.html&#34;&gt;your library&lt;/a&gt; uses an  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usefulutilities.com&#34;&gt;ezproxy server&lt;/a&gt; like ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;:  Don&amp;rsquo;t use the text I&amp;rsquo;ve displayed here for your own bookmarklet (it contains linebreaks and won&amp;rsquo;t be quite the right form for your browser).  Just drag this link &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;javascript:void(location.href=&#39;http://&#39;+location.host+&#39;.mate.lib.unimelb.edu.au&#39;+location.pathname+location.search)&#34;&gt;+mate.lib&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; to your bookmarks bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update 2&lt;/em&gt;: Thanks to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/index.php#c1449&#34;&gt;pointer from Richard Zach&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the link to preserve the search component of the URL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s one thing I find comments on a website really good for: trawling for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My spouse and I were talking over dessert this evening, over some &lt;em&gt;lemon delcious pudding&lt;/em&gt; that she had made.  She asked the question she asks every couple of years (when a self saucing pudding is made):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do self-saucing puddings work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They really are miraculous, and we haven&amp;rsquo;t got much of an idea of how the chemistry of these things makes them work.  A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22how+self-saucing+pudding+works%22&#34;&gt;cursory Googling&lt;/a&gt; reveals &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, and neither does a quick flick through &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684800012/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;On Food and Cooking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you help us?&lt;/p&gt;

On why one might allow them, or do without them. As you can see, I leave comments open here.  (Behind the scenes there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/&#34;&gt;hardworking comment spam filter&lt;/a&gt;.  Without that, this place would be deluged with spam.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand why one would want the place to yourself and do without comments.  However, if you do, and if you want your readers to &lt;em&gt;email you&lt;/em&gt; (as the author of &lt;a title=&#34;logicandlanguage.net: On Comments&#34; href=&#34;http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/on_comments_1.html#more&#34;&gt;logicandlanguage.net&lt;/a&gt; does) then &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let the reader know your email address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I sometimes catch the tram to get to or from the office, and usually it&amp;rsquo;s a not unpleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening was not one of the usual reasonably relaxing fifteen minute trips down Flemington Road and through Royal Park.  It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable how a violent scuffle between passengers can change the feeling throughout the tram.  There was pushing, shoving, curses and epithets, clutching at throats, and a tense standoff from the protagonists. Shocked stares, shy glances away, pleas of &amp;ldquo;calm down!&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;watch out!&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;cool it!&amp;rdquo; from the onlookers.  After the protagonists got off there were relieved sighs, a few tears, and a tram full of not-quite-returning-to-nomal people.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to edit the page you&amp;rsquo;re on, and freely create new pages by making new links, does seem to foster a new way of writing.  It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun to see if any of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/161-438_in_2005&#34;&gt;students catch on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in typesetting manuscripts in LaTeX, you might be interested in the notes I wrote up this evening.  One on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Page_Layout&#34;&gt;page layout&lt;/a&gt;, and the other on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page/PnC_Example_prooftrees&#34;&gt;proof trees&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in playing around on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/edit/page&#34;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, feel free.

      <title>Matt and Nick talk Dialetheism</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/01/10/matt_and_nick_talk_dialetheism/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/01/10/matt_and_nick_talk_dialetheism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt Carter and Nick Trakakis are &lt;a href=&#34;http://cogitation.braininavat.net/dialetheism.htm&#34;&gt;arguing over dialetheism&lt;/a&gt;.  What&amp;rsquo;s dialetheism?  It&amp;rsquo;s the view that some contradictory pairs of statements are true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that Nick is trying the line that contradictions (conjunctions of the form &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) are &lt;em&gt;meaningless&lt;/em&gt;.  I always find it hard to judge claims of meaninglessness (since I don&amp;rsquo;t have on hand a general theory of meaningfulness), but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great deal of sympathy for that line of argument.  I would have thought that it was because we &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt; the meaning the statement &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and not-&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; that we could see that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nick&amp;rsquo;s in good company here.  His view that contradictions (and tautologies) has proponents like the Wittgenstein of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/tlph.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tractatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying being back at work, but I seem to be procrastinating rather badly.  Instead of writing my grant application and getting through my growing pile of emails, I&amp;rsquo;m doing &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blame this on three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to deal with my emails and my grant application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently purchased two black-cover 100 page A4 spiral bound notebooks with nice blank white paper to scribble in, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://hans.presto.tripod.com/cat012.html&#34;&gt;cheap disposable fountain pens&lt;/a&gt; to scribble in them.  One notepad is for writing notes on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc&#34;&gt;draft book&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is for general scribbles and ideas.  The move from A5 (my old notebooks) to A4 is astonishing for getting ideas down.  A5 didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me at all well, compared to the A4 notebooks.  (I will resist the obvious extrapolation that an A3, or &amp;ndash; heaven forbid &amp;ndash; A2 or A1 size notebook would be spectacularly good.)  The ideas seem to be coming thicker and faster.  I recommend both the pen and the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas themselves, at the moment, simply fun to think about.  Yesterday and today I managed to sort through some ideas for Gentzen-style sequent calculi for normal modal logics.  The result is superficially like existing &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=hypersequent&#34;&gt;hypersequent&lt;/a&gt; calculi, but in fact it is much closer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=display+logic&#34;&gt;Display Logic&lt;/a&gt; (as you might expect, given my background and interests), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=calculus+of+structures&#34;&gt;Calculus of Structures&lt;/a&gt;.   The ideas of today and yesterday, were getting the sequent structures right.  It turns out that what you want &amp;ndash; to represent things cleanly &amp;ndash; is a simple linear notation for directed trees.  Call me mad, but I enjoy fiddling about constructing such things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I must get the paper written.  Before I do that, however, I have a big pile of email &amp;ndash; and a grant application &amp;ndash; to wrestle with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m back in the office, and back at work after my short Christmas/New Year break.  It&amp;rsquo;ll be time to plough through that 45-email inbox, and see what else is waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started converting the news item archive pages to the new template.  Expect more fiddling as I try to get them looking clearer.  (They seem a bit too &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; right now.)  There are changes under the hood to commenting too: I now use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://typekey.com&#34;&gt;TypeKey&lt;/a&gt; registration for comments.  If you have a TypeKey identity, use it.  If not, you can either &lt;a href=&#34;http://typekey.com&#34;&gt;sign up there&lt;/a&gt;, or wait for your comments to be vetted by me before they show up on the site.  This measure seems necessary to avoid all of the unsolicited comment spam this site has been suffering over the last months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if anything isn&amp;rsquo;t working for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2005 Redesign</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/01/01/2005_redesign/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2005 22:46:45 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2005/01/01/2005_redesign/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My redesign for 2005 is in progress now.  After some problems (I managed to delete the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page in a fit of cutting-and-pasting) I have some things on the way.  There are lots of changes behind the scene.  The linklist in the right column is now powered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://del.icio.us&#34;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;, which is wonderful.  The sidebars (left and right) contain other information, such as recent comments, recent udates on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page, and a little diary of events, past and present. Figuring out what goes where is all done automatically by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://movabletype.org&#34;&gt;weblog software I use&lt;/a&gt;.  I hope you find the new design of the front page useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve only got the front page working as of tonight, and it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get to bed.  The rest will come soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if the front page has any bugs when viewed in your browser.  Leave a message in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do hope that your 2005 is a fruitful one.  If there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unicef.org.au/Donate-Appeals-Detail.asp?AppealID=7&#34;&gt;something you can do&lt;/a&gt; to respond to the crisis in the wake of the tsunami crisis, then &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oxfam.org.au/world/emergencies/asia_tsunami.html&#34;&gt;do it&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems like the best thing that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; could be doing with money right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s going on around here</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/12/14/whats_going_on_around_here/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather busy for the last little while, as the absence from the website might indicate.  Here is a list of what&amp;rsquo;s been happening, which involves not a little bit of trumpet-blowing, because a lot of the news has been good and it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I spent an enjoyable (if rather &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt;) week in Canberra, touring the sights with Zachary in the mornings, and teaching at &lt;a href=&#34;http://lss.rsise.anu.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Logic Summer School&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoons.  Going through a rapid-fire course covering Turing machines, register machines, recursive functions, the halting problem, diagonalisation, formal arithmetic, representability, and G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s incompleteness results in 5 hours flat was a challenge.  I learned something setting it up and I hope the students learned something in the listening.  (They laughed at my jokes, which was very polite.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was looking after Z, C was at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://regnet.anu.edu.au/events/GovNet_RegNet_Conf/announcement.htm&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;, at which her &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0199264074/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;most recent book&lt;/a&gt; had its Australian launch.  Z and I crashed the launch party at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse&#34;&gt;University House&lt;/a&gt;, which was great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately upon our return to Melbourne, we went to some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livingroom.org.au/blog/archives/livingroom_wedding_1.php&#34;&gt;friends&amp;rsquo; wedding&lt;/a&gt; up near Marysville. The drive through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayObject.cfm/objectid.00064EAD-739A-1EF6-9E6080C476A90000/vvt.vhtml&#34;&gt;Black Spur&lt;/a&gt; would have been nice in and of itself. The touching wedding ceremony and socialising with friends out in attractive country was almost an excellent bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going away I heard three bits of good news.  First, I&amp;rsquo;m now on the editorial board of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  (My membership doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be on their website as yet, but it should be sometime soon.)  This was the site of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp&#34;&gt;first academic publication&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed to be on the editorial board now.  Send good papers to the journal.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great print journal with an enlightened open access policy for its &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt; (you get free access to papers older than five years).  The online archive goes back to &lt;em&gt;1960&lt;/em&gt;, which is seriously impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last round of ARC research grants was announced a little while ago and my last application with Graham Priest and Allen Hazen received &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/By_State-University_2005.pdf&#34;&gt;funding in the current round&lt;/a&gt;.  So, we&amp;rsquo;re receiving support for our projects, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have been elected as a Fellow of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.humanities.org.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Academy of the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.humanities.org.au/NewFellowsMediaRelease.PDF.pdf&#34;&gt;citation&lt;/a&gt; says exaggeratedly flattering things about me.  Thanks to everyone who put my name forward.  I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take these shoes&lt;br /&gt;
Click clacking down some dead end street&lt;br /&gt;
Take these shoes&lt;br /&gt;
And make them fit&lt;br /&gt;
Take this shirt&lt;br /&gt;
Polyester white trash made in nowhere&lt;br /&gt;
Take this shirt&lt;br /&gt;
And make it clean, clean&lt;br /&gt;
Take this soul&lt;br /&gt;
Stranded in some skin and bones&lt;br /&gt;
Take this soul&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/#Track11&#34;&gt;And make it sing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/&#34;&gt;not a bad album&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u2.com/htdaab-lyrics/#Track11&#34;&gt;not a bad song&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just bought some sheet music for the first time in 18 years or so.  Let&amp;rsquo;s hope my violin technique is up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.universaledition.com/truman/frontend/439_ue13360.pdf&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  I know I can play the &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; (or close approximations to them).  It&amp;rsquo;s sustaining the technique for 10 minutes that I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2005 we&amp;rsquo;re planning to travel, on sabbatical.  The C, G and Z show will be based in Oxford for &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ox/terms.html&#34;&gt;Michaelmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before arriving in Oxford, we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing some European touring.  C will be visiting a colleague in Denmark.  I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be presenting at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eudoxos.math.uoa.gr/~lc2005/&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium 2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Athens (July 28 to August 3), and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/&#34;&gt;ESSLLI2005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Edinburgh (I should be on in the second week, August 15 to 19).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;One stroke of good fortune today.  In a shopping trip with Z this afternoon, while looking for a &lt;em&gt;Super Secret Present&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jbhifi.com.au/&#34;&gt;JB Hi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; I found a set of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.headphone.com/layout.php?topicID=3&amp;amp;subTopicID=26&amp;amp;productID=0020080497&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 497&lt;/a&gt;s on sale.  Picking these &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000065BPC/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;sweet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.epinions.com/Sennheiser_HD_497_Headphones_Headphones/display_~reviews&#34;&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt; up for $15 was very very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially considering that this was approximately 80% off the list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and they&amp;rsquo;re very nice headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

Sad news tonight, with the conservatives returned with an increased majority here in Australia.  Most worrying is the fact that their representation is increased in the Senate. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have an interesting few years ahead.  (Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the forces for succession develop: Costello, Abbott, Turnbull&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>October 9 Election</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/08/29/october_9_election/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2004 20:46:26 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/08/29/october_9_election/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Our Federal Election is to be held on October 9.  Our current &lt;a href=&#34;http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/29/1093717818471.html&#34;&gt;Prime Minister says that this election is about &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the unannounced election campaign is over and the &lt;em&gt;announced&lt;/em&gt; one is on its way.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that we&amp;rsquo;ll get a government that we can, or should &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; in the result of this election, and I think that trust is rather a silly attitude to hold towards our elected representatives.  No, we should keep a keen eye on them, and get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; worried if we find that we start trusting them.  That&amp;rsquo;s about the time that they&amp;rsquo;ll abuse it.  It&amp;rsquo;s not that policians are any worse than the rest of us.  It&amp;rsquo;s that the position of power brings with it so many opportunities for abuse of that power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to the coming election, I can&amp;rsquo;t make a sensible prediction.  It seems like it will be close.  What worries me is that if the Howard/Costello Government is returned, then they will take this as an endorsement of the way that they have treated the public service as an arm of the party in power, inflaming insecurity and scapegoating asylum seekers assiduously ensuring that we do not understand the plight of those locked up without trial on our shores (and off them), mangled relations between government and our indigenous people, and cynically throwing buckets of money around in order to bribe voters in the leadup to this election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; take this current election to be about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling like redesigning this site, yet again.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot about the design here I like, yet it&amp;rsquo;s not quite &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; for some of what I want to do.  If you have any likes or dislikes about this place, please leave a comment here.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some ideas of what the redesign might feature, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get rid of anything that my three regular readers appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing work with Mark Lance, who&amp;rsquo;s been visiting the Philosophy Department for a couple of months to do research with me.  This has been immensely productive.  We seem to have a new story to tell about how to get semantics out of pragmatics.  Once you get a general story about the normative significance of &lt;em&gt;acts&lt;/em&gt; right, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to tell a general story about the normative significiance of &lt;em&gt;speech acts&lt;/em&gt;.  Or so it appears to us.  Expect to see a paper draft over in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; area before too long.  If all goes well, it seems like we&amp;rsquo;ll be committed to a book length project on this in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;em&gt;loving&lt;/em&gt; my teaching.  Just doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;intro logic&lt;/a&gt; has been a dream, and the students seem to be keen and bright, and the lectures have been fun.  That they manage to (1) laugh at my jokes, (2) listen to the content, (3) engage and ask smart questions, makes teaching very easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling a few minor illnesses over the last few weeks, just as winter slowly battles with the emerging spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled a few random pieces from IKEA, slowly making our home more homely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing up a couple of talks for the logic-seminars here on proof shape.  The work on quantifiers and modal operators seems to be stabilising, and I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I know how to best state the formal results.  Alas, the seminar room won&amp;rsquo;t have digital projection, and I won&amp;rsquo;t have completed making digital slides with &lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer&lt;/a&gt; anyway, so I&amp;rsquo;m resorting to the old multicolour pens and overhead transparencies.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t done &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C, Z and I have been enjoying becoming a part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livingroom.org.au/home.php&#34;&gt;Living Room&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m fighting my way through administrative tasks, such as applying for study leave in Semester 2, 2005, and completing my probation report, so that I get confirmed in my position here and not booted out of the university, and other tasks too tedious to recite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for me for now.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be back with something more philosophically illuminating later, when I write up a quick response here to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www3.oup.co.uk/ajphil/hdb/Volume_82/Issue_03/820409.sgm.abs.html&#34;&gt;Nicole Wyatt&amp;rsquo;s nice paper&lt;/a&gt; criticising JC&amp;rsquo;s and my position on logical pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parent/Teacher Interview</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/07/26/parentteacher_interview/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This morning I had my first ever &amp;ldquo;parent/teacher interview,&amp;rdquo; with Z&amp;rsquo;s carers at childcare.  They seem to like him, and he generally likes them (though Z is choosy when it comes to who counts as his &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;: the select group is pretty small at the moment).  So now I know how they take him to be going on emotional, social, cognitive and motor development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And according to the carers (who have scales and developmental criteria and all of that kind of stuff) he&amp;rsquo;s going pretty darn well.  So, I suppose we have passed this &amp;ldquo;test.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Elsewhere is lots of fun, and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the way through, we seem to be having a very good time.  I&amp;rsquo;ll report back with some highlights later.  But now I&amp;rsquo;m off to another talk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This last couple of weeks has been super-busy-hectic.  Z and I fly up north this afternoon for a family visit.  On Sunday I go off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/aap2004/&#34;&gt;AAP Conference&lt;/a&gt; at South Molle, and Z stays with his Granddad for a couple of days, to be joined by his mum who returns from her little Europe conference trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One piece of advice: If you&amp;rsquo;re preparing a conference presentation with simple dot-and-line pictures, and you&amp;rsquo;d like them to be presented &lt;em&gt;dynamically&lt;/em&gt;, then the LaTeX packages &lt;a href=&#34;http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;beamer and pgf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/acdei_talk.pdf&#34;&gt;are your friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organising Academic Papers</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is a question which is much more sensible to ask than you might otherwise think: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://freelancepropaganda.com/archives/MP3vPDF.pdf&#34;&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I manage academic papers like MP3s?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (the link is to a pdf of a paper by James Howison and Abby Goodrum).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;paper archive&amp;rdquo; is a fairly large 2GB (not as big as my &amp;ldquo;music archive&amp;rdquo;, I suppose) with about 6000 papers, and it&amp;rsquo;s catergorised under author (approx 2000 of those).  If anyone can produce a way that enables me to sort, label, filter, slice and dice these just as smoothly as &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/itunes/&#34;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; does my mp3s, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a very happy academic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slow Period</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/06/18/slow_period/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2004 21:00:14 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/06/18/slow_period/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a slow period on the &amp;rsquo;net for me in the next little while.  My creaky powerbook seems to have developed yet another fault (now its AirPort connection is completely bung, so I&amp;rsquo;m only online at home when I directly plug in to the ADSL modem, which boots off the other users of the connection).  This, together with the wonky right hinge and the intermittent backlight might mean that it&amp;rsquo;s time to put the poor thing in for a service to see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to shoehorn as many files as possible into our family&amp;rsquo;s surplus-to-requirements iBook (though the step down to the small screen, the slow processor and the cramped memory will not be good), but I have rather too many things to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m not looking forward to the experience.  I can&amp;rsquo;t be out of computer action while my powerbook is in for a service, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really afford the time to do the brain transplant.  That means I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t afford the time to be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no accounting for musical taste.  This morning Z was a little upset. I decided to put on some music for him.  First selection: &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=341061&#34;&gt;Big Red Car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little voice responds, with a tremor.  &amp;ldquo;Dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask, &amp;ldquo;Zack, what is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want this on.  I want &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;OK.&amp;rdquo; Takes CD out.  Replaces it.  &amp;ldquo;Is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ozmusiconline.com.au/product_info.php/cPath/190093_190083_190088_190076_190783/products_id/333046?osCsid=b22bab9d670495188ce4969e15349660&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; any better?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sounds much brighter.  &amp;ldquo;Good!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d comment on &lt;em&gt;Big Brother&lt;/em&gt;, but when I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/13/1087065031443.html?oneclick=true&#34;&gt;learned that the &lt;em&gt;inmates&lt;/em&gt; aren&amp;rsquo;t even allowed &lt;em&gt;writing implements&lt;/em&gt; inside&lt;/a&gt;, I am convinced that the place is completely inhumane.  I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine a life where I can&amp;rsquo;t write, whether on paper or on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that the restriction serves a couple of goals of the producer.  (1) no passing notes from inmate to inmate: all communication must be picked up by the microphones. (2) no writing of diaries (and all that that entails).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, hey, Merlin Luck&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/14/1087065042010.html&#34;&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; was great.  Good on him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is my &lt;em&gt;favourite&lt;/em&gt; paper of the last few years.  At last, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished wrestling with the diagrams in the paper and &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/gndl/&#34;&gt;The Geometry of Non-Distributive Logics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; can now see light of day.  My superb and long-suffering co-author &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unica.it/~paoli/&#34;&gt;Francesco Paoli&lt;/a&gt; and I have been working on this on-and-off since we met and talked about this material in the middle of 2001.  Francesco provided a great draft, which sat in my pile of things to do for altogether too long as I tried to get the diagrams to look legible.  Anyway, after some gentle reminding from Francesco, and after a few late nights and debugging &lt;a href=&#34;http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html&#34;&gt;MetaPost&lt;/a&gt; code, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished a draft of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the first completed technical work in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;proof project&lt;/a&gt;, to go alongside &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/assertiondenialparadox/&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/lnclem/&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adcei/&#34;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just miss out on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=46828&#34;&gt;Zermelo&lt;/a&gt; who was a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=11370&#34;&gt;Fuchs&lt;/a&gt; (a great^6 grandfather), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=29561&#34;&gt;Cantor&lt;/a&gt;, who was a student of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=7486&#34;&gt;Weierstrass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=18331&#34;&gt;Kummer&lt;/a&gt; (both great^7 grandfathers of mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I learned of this just now through my academic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=35034&#34;&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; who learned it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=15663&#34;&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a household, we&amp;rsquo;re running at an annual rate somewhere between 30 and 40 tonnes. (The indeterminacy here is chiefly due to my ignorance about the number of flights we&amp;rsquo;re making this year.)  Our car useage is a pretty skimpy 1.8 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you&amp;rsquo;re wondering where I am?  This is the last teaching week of semester, and I&amp;rsquo;m busy teaching, organising a couple of conferences, writing papers and doing a bundle of other stuff.  Expect to see some more things in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

It should be lots of fun, if you like philosophy, meaning theory, logic and that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/notevery&#34;&gt;Not Every Truth Can Be Known&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; is now up to version 0.9, and it&amp;rsquo;s having its first public beta test on Friday morning in the local logic seminar.  Come along (Cussonia Court Room 1, University of Melbourne, Friday 11am) and enjoy the ride if you like that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine reminded me that when talking about epistemic logic one should, of course, cite Donald Rumsfeld&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3254852.stm&#34;&gt;famous&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;infamous&lt;/em&gt;?) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2002/t02122002_t212sdv2.html&#34;&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; about the known knowns, the known unknowns, and the unknown unknowns.  (Does the fact that he didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the unknown knowns mean that he implicitly endorses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=kk+thesis&#34;&gt;KK thesis&lt;/a&gt;?  Who can tell?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/notevery&#34;&gt;take a look at the paper&lt;/a&gt; (the changes from 0.85 to 0.9 are mainly bugfixes and exposition changes, no pictures yet, though I promise they will come &lt;em&gt;someday&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/notevery&#34;&gt;let me know what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Haskell and Logic</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/05/10/haskell_and_logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2004 22:04:06 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/05/10/haskell_and_logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This looks very nice indeed: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/HR/&#34;&gt;The Haskell Road&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a textbook on elementary logic, mathematics and programming, based around my favourite programming language &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org&#34;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the textbook in my introductory computer science course, long ago in 1986.  If it were, I may have fallen in love with computing and never become a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark 1&lt;/em&gt;: How a textbook based on Haskell, a computer programming language that wasn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html&#34;&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 is a matter for counterfactual speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parenthetical remark 2&lt;/em&gt;: I did do a section on Miranda in a &lt;em&gt;Declarative Programming&lt;/em&gt; course in my second year, in 1987.  I see &lt;a href=&#34;http://haskell.org/haskell-history.html&#34;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; that this was pretty cutting-edge stuff.  By this time, however, the mystique of late night (and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; night) debugging sessions had well-and-truly worn off, and I&amp;rsquo;ve become a philosopher, after a brief stint trying to become a mathematician instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Christine received an &lt;a href=&#34;http://nadelectronics.com/cd_players/C521BEE_framset.htm&#34;&gt;early Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day present&lt;/a&gt;.  The NAD C521BEE &lt;a href=&#34;http://nadelectronics.com/reviews/C521BEE_0903_framset.htm&#34;&gt;sounds gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;.  A weclome bonus is that it plays every CD we feed it, unlike our dearly departed Yamaha CD player, which served us well for the last 10 years or so, but it started giving up the ghost (being very picky about what CDs it felt like playing) over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if only our &lt;a href=&#34;http://207.228.230.231/info/NAD_701.pdf&#34;&gt;receiver&lt;/a&gt; would actually show us the frequency it&amp;rsquo;s tuned to on its front panel!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/04/21/the_ajl_is_on_the_register/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just heard that the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; will soon appear in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au&#34;&gt;DEST&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals&#34;&gt;Register of Refereed Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are an editor of a refereed journal, please take the time to get your journal registered on this list.  (It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm#journals&#34;&gt;submission process&lt;/a&gt; is straightforward.)  If you are on this list, then Australians who publish in your journal will not have to bug you for a letter indicating that your journal peer-referees its articles. (Why?  Because peer review makes an article &lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt; in DEST&amp;rsquo;s scheme assigning brownie points for research output, which means more &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; for your institution, hence the need to prove it.) So, being on the register saves you, the journal editor (or your admin staff if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have any, I suppose) time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on the register will also make you attractive to Australian authors.  I note that precious few philosophy or journals are yet on the register.  Consider this a plea to get more on that list.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve got some research money, and I&amp;rsquo;m using it to buy out some teaching to give me more time to &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt;.

      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2004 19:42:39 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/04/17/busyquiet_period_2_and_email/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Now that Christine&amp;rsquo;s back from overseas, I seem to have entered &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/30/busyquiet_period&#34;&gt;another busy/quiet period&lt;/a&gt;.  In the last week we have had Z&amp;rsquo;s birthday (he&amp;rsquo;s now a precocious three-year-old), Easter, our midsemester break, various small house renovation things, and catching up on previously unattended email.  (The inbox is down to two items as of this afternoon, both of which came in today, so that&amp;rsquo;s going fairly well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of email, it&amp;rsquo;s been interesting to see how the topic of &lt;a href=&#34;http://raelity.org/computers/internet/email/archive.html&#34;&gt;email filing practices&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antisleep.com/archives/2002-11-25_0184.php&#34;&gt;aether&lt;/a&gt;, now that &lt;a href=&#34;http://gmail.google.com&#34;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; is there, tempting you to archive all of your email and use &lt;em&gt;search&lt;/em&gt; to get at it, instead of filing it away in different folders.  My own email folder hieararchy is slowly spiralling out of control: the act of asking &amp;ldquo;where should I file this?&amp;rdquo; (and answering it) is becoming stressful, and burrowing through folders to find things (did I put it in the &lt;em&gt;Teaching&lt;/em&gt; folder orthe &lt;em&gt;Admin&lt;/em&gt; folder or&amp;hellip;?) is tedious. I am tempted to ditch the folder hierarchy completely and stick everything in an archive folder and let the pretty competent search box in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/&#34;&gt;mail client&lt;/a&gt; dig up what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I won&amp;rsquo;t do that yet.  I&amp;rsquo;d like two features I currently don&amp;rsquo;t have in my mail client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labels or categories&lt;/em&gt;: I want to label all of my correspondence to do with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl/&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt; (to pick a salient example) with an &amp;ldquo;AJL&amp;rdquo; label, so that I can pull them out when I want to see all of my AJL correspondence in one pile.  (Not all AJL email contains the text &amp;lsquo;AJL&amp;rsquo;, so searching for it does not necessarily help.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Configurable Views&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;d like a &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; folder of everything labelled &amp;ldquo;AJL.&amp;rdquo;  When I&amp;rsquo;m collaborating with Person &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d like a virtual folder containing of all of my email to or from Person &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, different mail clients out there have some combination of these things.  The scary thing, when I think about it, is that what I&amp;rsquo;m asking for is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/&#34;&gt;iPhoto&lt;/a&gt; for my mail archive.  (Though without the rating feature.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to rate my emails from 1 to 5 stars!)  Maybe Apple will add these features to the venerable Mail application.  Maybe someone else will build a robust mail client for Mac OS X with the combination of fast content-based search, arbitrary labels and configurable views.  If you hear of one, please let me know.  My 660MB ~/Library/Mail/ folder and I will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

The University&amp;rsquo;s council chambers are in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/general/&#34;&gt;our building&lt;/a&gt;, and the building was locked down from 11:30 this morning, in preparation for the protests.  (We were asked to leave the building for the rest of the day.) The council met this afternoon, but, despite the security guards and police presence ringing the building, council met elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technical &#39;Support&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Are computer technical &amp;ldquo;support&amp;rdquo; positions staffed by robots?  Or are they simply underqualified, underpaid people in call/email centres?  Probably the latter, as far as my experience (limited to just one case, of course) is concerned.  Let me cast my support request out to cyberspace to see if I receive a more useful response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just purchased an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000C9ZJV/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;HP PSC 1350&lt;/a&gt;, a little all-in-one inkjet printer, scanner and copier.  It&amp;rsquo;s very nice.  It prints, it scans, it copies, it&amp;rsquo;s very small and fits snugly on my bookshelf near my desk at home. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit loud, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m using it with my Powerbook G4, running Mac OS X 10.3.3.  All of the information I have received indicates that it comes with OCR software.  However, none seems to have been installed with the HP installer.  Have I been &lt;a href=&#34;http://h20015.www2.hp.com/en/documentIndex.jhtml?reg=&amp;plc=&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodId=hppsc1350a306888&amp;cat=use&amp;docparent=78701037&amp;pagetype=78701036&#34;&gt;deceived&lt;/a&gt;?  Was my box missing some software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first response from HP tech support was what you might have expected from a simple pattern matching algorithm.  I described my problem as I did above, indicating how I&amp;rsquo;d installed the software, and saying that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the ReadIRIS OCR software, and that in the HP scanner software there was no &amp;ldquo;send this to a text editor&amp;rdquo; option available (contrary to the printed and online manuals).  The response (taking the form of some parts of the manual sent back to me) contained no indication that my query was actually read beyond the first phrase saying &amp;ldquo;I cannot perform OCR with my scanner.&amp;rdquo; The part where they said &amp;ldquo;And you can perform OCR from within the ReadIRIS application&amp;rdquo; when I had already said that the application wasn&amp;rsquo;t installed was a particularly nice example of the failure of comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent a second query, reiterating the problem and indicating why their response missed the point.  I am yet to receive a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m at your mercy.  Does anyone here have any experience with this?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a research project for you.  Look at the physical interpretation of intuitionistic logic in the Markopoulou and Bell papers I &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/30/what_the_universe_looks_like_from_the_inside&#34;&gt;mentioned yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, mix in Nuel Belnap&amp;rsquo;s really interesting account of an indeterministic relativistic universe in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001003/&#34;&gt;Branching Space-time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and the Thomason point/history semantics for temporal logic motivated and justified in Belnap and Green&amp;rsquo;s wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.people.virginia.edu/~msg6m/trl.pdf&#34; title=&#34;A 2.9MB PDF file: download at your peril&#34;&gt;Indeterminism and The Thin Red Line&lt;/a&gt;, and stir thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you cook up.  I think it could be really &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;.  In fact, you could come &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as a graduate student and do a project just like this one.  This would be a great M.A. or Ph.D. thesis topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The mathematically/logically/physically minded among you should take a look at &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9811053&#34; title=&#34;[gr-qc/9811053]&#34;&gt;The internal description of a causal set: What the universe looks like from the inside&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/researchers/view_bio.cfm?id=18&#34;&gt;Fotini Markopoulou&lt;/a&gt;.  (Found from a reference to in &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Two%20Approaches%20to%20Modelling%20the%20Universe.pdf&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/Causal%20sets%20and%20Frame-Valued%20Set%20Theory.pdf&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell&#34;&gt;John Bell&lt;/a&gt;, which was found in turn by way of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/Archives/002689.html&#34;&gt;Brian Weatherson&lt;/a&gt;.)  This is interesting, deep material at the intersection between the semantics for non-classical logics and difficult physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&#34;http://cgpg.gravity.psu.edu/online/Html/Seminars/Fall1998/Markopoulou/Slides/s01.html&#34;&gt;handwritten slides&lt;/a&gt; are available for a talk she gave on the topic.  Handwritten slides from talks given by mathematicians or physicists are often very revealing: they present the flavour of the material succinctly and often with flair and character.  Will this survive the transition to digital production of slides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a snippets entry, but by the time I got to paragraph 2, I realised it was time for it to move left.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brandom on Philosophy and the University</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2004 22:02:53 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Robert Brandom recently addressed the trustees at the University of Pittsburgh (where he works).  His talk addressed different issues, including the history of the Pitt philosophy department, the role of a research university, and how we ought to conceive of the relationship between the university and its students. Go &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umc.pitt.edu:591/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;amp;-lay=a&amp;amp;-format=d.html&amp;amp;storyid=1962&amp;amp;-Find&#34;&gt;read this extract of the speech&lt;/a&gt; and then come back here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re back?  Good.  Here are some thoughts of mine.  Use the comments section to add thoughts of your own (or to express disagreement with mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any idea how I could go about convincing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;my university&lt;/a&gt; that every undergraduate student should take at least one philosophy subject? That would &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; change things here to a considerable degree.  We teach nowhere near that fraction of the undergraduate student body, despite having a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/firstyear.html&#34;&gt;very wide range&lt;/a&gt; of introductory subjects.  Melbourne prides itself on giving its students a liberal education, but we don&amp;rsquo;t do &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; well at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note Brandom&amp;rsquo;s claim that the fact that each senior academic teaches one intro course each year (of two hours contact a week) gives these senior philosophers the heaviest load among cognate disciplines in the university.  Here, our undergraduate (including honours) teaching load has been 2+2 (two courses a semester, both semesters).  Typically it&amp;rsquo;s one first year subject, two second-third year subjects, and one honours subject.  This is pretty good for the discipline Australia-wide, I think, but it&amp;rsquo;s high when we compare ourselves to our colleagues in the rest of the Arts Faculty.  We are attempting a restructure of our anarchic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/&#34;&gt;course offerings&lt;/a&gt; which will give us (if all goes well) very nearly a 2+1 load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most interesting point &amp;ndash; to me, at least &amp;ndash; was the description of the way that many students don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate being made to take a philosophy course.  Despite this, they get good course evaluations, presumably indicating that the students enjoy it and have &amp;ldquo;come around&amp;rdquo; by the end.  He makes the following inference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This underlines what is wrong with thinking of our students as customers, whose desires ought to drive our offerings. If we just give the students what they want, half of them would do nothing but channel-surf through undemanding courses on the symbolism of the Matrix movies and what the popularity of reality TV says about contemporary culture&amp;ndash;with lots of video-viewing time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A somewhat better model than that of commercial customer is that of professional client, in relation, for instance, to a doctor or lawyer. No one with any sense goes to their counselor and says: Prescribe this drug for me in this dosage, or file a lawsuit for me under this section of the Uniform Commercial Code. One goes instead for access to a different kind of judgment and advice, which one wants to take account of a whole range of possibilities and constraints initially visible only to the professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what struck me most heavily.  I agree with the sentiment, that students are here to be informed, and to be informed is, at least partially, to be &lt;em&gt;formed&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; to put yourself (not uncritically) at the mercy (at least in part) of your teacher.  You take your teacher to be an authority: not an infallible authority, of course, but an authority at least in a provisional sense.  We can&amp;rsquo;t think of students as mere &amp;ldquo;customers&amp;rdquo; in this game because of this kind of relationship.  This much seems good sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the attitude that &amp;ldquo;half of my students would prefer to just slack off&amp;rdquo; strikes me as condescending.  But is there a way of expressing the point without being condescending?  Am I hopelessly na&amp;iuml;ve in thinking that most of my students actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to learn?  Maybe this is the happy flip-side of our status as an elective subject for anyone on campus.  No-one is forced to take philosophy subjects, so everyone who does &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they are my thoughts. &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/24/brandom_on_philosophy_and_the_university&#34;&gt;What do you think?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Today I received offprints of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pev/&#34;&gt;Paraconsistency Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; an article I wrote quite some time ago (it was essentially finished in 2001).  It appears in the &lt;em&gt;2002&lt;/em&gt; issue of the Journal, yet it has only just appeared on my desk.  This comical state of affairs continues when you look at the bottom of &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org:80/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.ndjfl/1074290713&#34;&gt;the published article&lt;/a&gt; where it indicates that the paper was &amp;ldquo;Received February 13, 2002; accepted February 5, 2003; printed December 19, 2003,&amp;rdquo; yet at the top of the page it says &amp;ldquo;Volume 43, Number 3, 2002.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the offprints of the article &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;.  Clearly, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/ndjfl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a very fine journal indeed) is fighting a severe backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a matter only for tea-room (and weblog) conversation and nothing more were it not for one thing.  Australian academics publish under the shadow of a stringent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/highered/research/herdc.htm&#34;&gt;data collection regime&lt;/a&gt; according to which everything we get published in a year is collected early in the following year, categorised, and the resulting figures help determine the amount of research funding your university will receive.  Funding is always tight, and you want to ensure that your publications pull their weight and your institution receives its proper &amp;ldquo;reward.&amp;rdquo; If something comes in &lt;em&gt;too late&lt;/em&gt; for the census for the previous year (as it almost certainly seems to have in this case, as the census date has passed) it does not count, and the University receives nothing.    The University is, understandably, quite keen to receive funding on the basis of &amp;ldquo;research performance,&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree that if that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re being funded, the funding levels should bear some significant relation to the research actually carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, no doubt, will influence future funding decisions for academics like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Addendum: It turns out that this article &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be counted for the 2003 census. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Research Office&lt;/a&gt; was able to add it as a late entry.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night I went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonyclassics.com/fogofwar/&#34;&gt;Fog of War&lt;/a&gt; with my brother-in-law, who is visiting Melbourne for a few days.  I was absolutely knackered (must have been something to do with staying up until 1:30 that morning getting the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/logical_pluralism/&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; away to the publisher), but I managed to stay conscious for 95% of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a striking movie in a number of different ways. One I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen mentioned in any of the reviews I read before the movie was the beautiful &lt;a href=&#34;http://rgable.typepad.com/aworks/2004/01/the_fog_of_war_.html&#34;&gt;Philip Glass soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;.  It suited the movie down to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book&#34;&gt;discussion on book publishing&lt;/a&gt; continuing.  I have 11 comments, over half of whom are written by people who are not me.  I like having smart readers who have opinions and are able to articulate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amirrorclear.net/&#34;&gt;Toby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s prompting, I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuffing around with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/2004.css&#34;&gt;stylesheet&lt;/a&gt; for this page. He thought (and I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree) that the background colour between the different content rectangles was too &amp;ldquo;white.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;rsquo;ve changed it, but I don&amp;rsquo;t like the result either.  As of today it&amp;rsquo;s #eff8d1.   Any takers for a better background colour?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A corridor discussion with Allen Hazen this morning about permission statements, prompted by the well-known observation that when we say &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; we really mean &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and you can do &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, led me to show that (under certain assumptions) there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a two-place connective (call it &amp;lsquo;erk&amp;rsquo;) such that &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; erk &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is equivalent to &amp;ldquo;you can do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and you can do &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s just that &amp;ldquo;erk&amp;rdquo; is not disjunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m in two minds as to what to do.  I want to write this up for public consumption, and this is a nice place to do it.  But I also think that setting that topic as an assignment question for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161212/pub/&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Logic class&lt;/a&gt; would be most appropriate.  It would be simple to do both, except that I&amp;rsquo;m confident that some of my students in Non-Classical Logic read this site. (Hi guys!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what should I do?  Post here?  Set it as an assignment?  Both?  Neither?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Publishing a Book</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2004 21:33:24 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/18/publishing_a_book/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
On and off, I&#39;ve been thinking about what I&#39;m going to do with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;next book&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean, I&#39;m planning to write the thing, and to see to it that it is published by a decent publisher.  So much is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for it to get the kind of institutional recognition that is necessary for people in a position like mine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, I&#39;m looking for something more than that.  I&#39;m looking for my book to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;.  Getting read is more difficult than getting published, given the avalanche of academic material published each year.  I&#39;m hoping for this book to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt;, for it to be &lt;em&gt;assigned as a textbook&lt;/em&gt;, for it to &lt;em&gt;corrupt the minds of the youth&lt;/em&gt;, and for it to &lt;em&gt;shape the field for years to come&lt;/em&gt;.  (I may as well aim high.)  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have come to the conclusion that one very good way for me to do this is for me to give the book away for free: I plan to post the book chapters, as they&#39;re written, online here, to have them indexed by search engines, to get people like you linking to it on your website, glancing through it, giving me feedback, helping me to improve it, etc., and to link to it, making it appear higher in search rankings, and giving other people more ways to stumble onto it, etc.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, there are quite a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://craphound.net/down&#34;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://craphound.net/est&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in the publishing world already.  People give away electronic copies of their book, and despite this &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; people buy the physical thing published by the publisher.  After all, there&#39;s something useful in letting the experts print and bind a copy, instead of you dealing with all of that hassle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can this be done with &lt;em&gt;academic&lt;/em&gt; books?  It turns out that it&#39;s already been done here too.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/&#34;&gt;Allen Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;, the topologist at Cornell, has published his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algebraic Topology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; textbook with Cambridge University Press, and he still &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html&#34;&gt;offers the whole thing for a free download&lt;/a&gt; at his site. This is unbelievably smart, if Allen&#39;s aim (as I suspect it is) is to be &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; by readers.  Allen&#39;s distribution rights are more restrictive than some public distribution conditions: he, and Cambridge University Press, allow you to print a single copy of the book from the files for personal use, but not to photocopy multiple copies.  This is not exactly simple for them to enforce, but you can understand why they make this restriction.  The files distributed are completely unencumbered PDF files, which print just as nicely as the Cambridge University Press version of his book.  (This, in my view, is much better than the state of play with most e-books which are typographically very poor.  That&#39;s not too problematic for a novel, but it&#39;s impossible for a mathematical text which requires fine typographical control to get the mathematics both correct and legible.)  What is the end result?  Allen Hatcher is (at the time of writing) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=algebraic+topology&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&#34;&gt;Google hit number 4 on algebraic topology&lt;/a&gt;, his book is how I learn any algebraic topology I need to know, and the dead tree version for sale &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0521795400/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has a much higher sales rank than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/041521534X/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;my book on substructural logic&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I think I will head down this path with &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Next Book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Do you have any advice for me?  Is it a silly idea or not? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Messenger Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Bruce Cockburn (&lt;em&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve Never Seen Everything&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Envy The Wind&lt;/em&gt;: Lucinda Williams (&lt;em&gt;Essence&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting collection.  Bruce Cockburn is over-represented considering that he&amp;rsquo;s only 609.4MB out of 14.57GB, but perhaps he has a thing for the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Note added on March 17: In the original post I had  the albums of the two Bruce Cockburn songs around the wrong way.  Not that any of us noticed, or anything.]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are God&#39;s Hands Tied By Logic?</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/12/are_gods_hands_tied_by_logic/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2004 12:12:44 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/12/are_gods_hands_tied_by_logic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Reading the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000102/index.html&#34;&gt;paper with this title&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arsdisputandi.org/&#34;&gt;online journal&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consequence for philosophy of religion is quite simple--that if God is an  agent, his hands must be bound by logic. To many, this might seem to be a conclusion which is so trivial as to be scarcely worth stating--apart from Descartes, and a few other exceptions, have not most philosophers of religion always held that God&#39;s omnipotence does not include the ability to do illogical things?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want to &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; this conclusion, but I do want to give it a bit of a shake.  It strikes me that there&#39;s a much more general point lurking around here somewhere, that it says little interesting about God (after all, we&#39;re &#34;bound by logic&#34; just as much as God is), and, maybe more surprisingly, it says little interesting about &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt; either.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The idea is this: how do we conclude that God&#39;s hands &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; tied by logic?  We conclude that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;logically impossible&lt;/em&gt; for God to do something which is prohibited by &lt;em&gt;logic&lt;/em&gt;.  God can&#39;t square a circle, or make a tautology untrue, or do anything else like that.  Why is this?  It&#39;s because it&#39;s logically necessary that if something is logically necessary, it&#39;s true.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, logical necessity (which I&#39;ll represent by &#39;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&#39;) satisfies the following condition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Lp&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; distinctively true of logical necessity.  Lots of other operators satisfy this condition too.  (1) It&#39;s quite plausible to think that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; necessary that what&#39;s &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; necessary is true.   (2) When you think about it, it&#39;s obvious that it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true that what&#39;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; true is true. (3)  I have even convinced myself that &lt;em&gt;it would be nice that&lt;/em&gt; (if &lt;em&gt;it would be nice that p&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)!  And there are more where they came from. (If you like possible worlds semantics, let the accessibility relation governing &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; satisfy the condition that if a world &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; is accessed by a world &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; accesses itself too. Then &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Lp&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; is always satisfied).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, what&#39;s the upshot?  For any modality &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; satisfying this condition, it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; necessary that what is &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; necessary is true.  That is, in particular it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;-necessary that God not do things that are &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;-impossible.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What&#39;s the upshot of this conclusion?  Consider the case of a trivial modality like the temporal &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;. Even though God will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; for do something which doesn&#39;t at some time, that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no broader sense of &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; for which it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that God to do something which doesn&#39;t actually happen.  Now consider physical possibility.  Even though it is &lt;em&gt;physically impossible&lt;/em&gt; for God to do something which breaks the laws of physics (whatever the actual laws might be, thinking of them as universally true regularities, not things with actual exceptions), there can still be a broader sense of possibility, according to which it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that the laws of physics be different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; issue is whether there&#39;s any reason to think that  the modality of &lt;em&gt;logical necessity&lt;/em&gt; is any different to the others, or whether we could consider yet &lt;em&gt;broader&lt;/em&gt; senses of possibility.  &lt;em&gt;That&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; the place to look for something distinctive about the nature of the grip of logical necessity.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching, teaching, teaching</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/11/teaching_teaching_teaching/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2004 21:35:22 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/11/teaching_teaching_teaching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Teaching for 2004 Semester 1 is now well underway.  My classes for this term have been enjoyable in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;Non-Classical Logic&lt;/em&gt; is a second/third level logic class.  I&#39;ve decided to follow Graham Priest&#39;s book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/052179434X/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt; rather closely, which means I don&#39;t need to make too many further decisions.  (It&#39;s designed to fit into an Australian academic semester, and to follow an intro logic course just like &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;.)  The book doesn&#39;t take &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the line I&#39;d follow, but it&#39;s much better than a merely &#34;good enough&#34; book that I&#39;d use through gritted teeth. My differences with Graham&#39;s view of things are two.  &lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li style=&#34;margin-top:5px;&#34;&gt; Graham structures the course around the search for a good semantics for the conditional of natural language.  I think that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; question is both easier (for many purposes -- think of mathematical reasoning -- the &#34;material conditional&#34; is just fine and dandy, thankyou very much) and more difficult (there&#39;s all sorts of context sensitivity in conditional constructions which a sensible look at would take you very very far away from a second-level undergraduate course) than Graham concedes, so I don&#39;t get as much out of the central theme as Graham does.&lt;/li&gt;   
&lt;li&gt; I think that there is more mileage you can get out of the idea of a &lt;em&gt;normal modal logic&lt;/em&gt; than Graham manages to express in his Chapter 3.  The ideas of modal logic are just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; fruitful and &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; beautiful, that I can&#39;t speed over them in just one chapter.  Think &lt;em&gt;temporal&lt;/em&gt; logic, &lt;em&gt;deontic&lt;/em&gt; logic, &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; logic,  etc., etc&amp;nbsp;...  Here, the formal stuff is just so beautiful that I need to do more than Graham does with this material.  This is, as far as I can tell, a matter of &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt;, and this is one place that my taste differs from Graham&#39;s, and it shows.  There is more to be said for the role of the teacher as a cultivator of taste, but I must leave that for another time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Teaching this class is enjoyable because I know the material like the back of my hand, the students are (mostly) keen to learn, and it&#39;s a healthy mix of teaching different kinds of constructions, proving theorems, and doing philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; My &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; major responsibility is my fourth-year honours seminar entitled &lt;em&gt;Logic &amp;amp; Philosophy&lt;/em&gt;.  This year we&#39;re going through some of Robert Brandom&#39;s greatest hits, starting with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674001583/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Articulating Reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, glancing aside to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674543300/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making it Explicit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where necessary (the running joke is that &lt;em&gt;Articulating Reasons&lt;/em&gt; should be subtitled &#34;Making &lt;em&gt;Making it Explicit&lt;/em&gt; Explicit&#34;) and then on to some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674009037/nosim/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales of the Mighty Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a &#34;big picture&#34; philosophy course, taking in history, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, normative theory, philosophy of logic, and the kitchen sink.  I&#39;m uneasy with anticipation when I wonder what the students (and here I have a smaller group of about twelve) will make of it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; teaching responsibilities, I have a small honours reading course in modal logic that I&#39;m taking with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/staff/tr.html#allen&#34;&gt;Allen Hazen&lt;/a&gt;, a new honours student to supervise, a couple of continuing Ph.D. students, and two and a half &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; Ph.D. students, all working on interesting projects.  I have to keep up with inferentialism and Kant&#39;s theory of judgement, non-standard probability theory, ontology, Carnap &amp;amp; van Fraassen &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;stances&lt;/em&gt;, and the distinction between pure and depraved &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;.  This, in case you were wondering, is why I&#39;m sometimes just a little behind on other things.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reboot</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/08/reboot/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2004 20:05:54 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2004/03/08/reboot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;
This site has been sitting fallow for eleven months.  That&#39;s far too long in short-attention web land, so no doubt I&#39;ve lost my vast readership.  It&#39;s time to reboot it, so here we go.  There are a few changes that have been on my mind for some time.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;. Tired of white, tired of websafe colours, I&#39;ve gone to earth tones for a change.  Sterility be gone!  I&#39;ve only checked in a couple of different browsers, so let me know if there are any bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&#39;ve succumbed to weblog-ism just a little.  I&#39;ve swapped the news section with one of the sidebars, mainly so that I can post more photos in the &#34;News&#34; section of the site without the restriction to a 250 pixel width in the right column.  Now I have more options, and I might just post more pictures here.  It should also give me room to post more &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; here, like all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/tar/&#34;&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umsu.de/wo/index.php&#34;&gt;kids&lt;/a&gt; are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I&#39;ve upgraded to the latest version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://movabletype.org&#34;&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; to run this thing.  I&#39;ve also decided to turn on comments on the &lt;em&gt;News&lt;/em&gt; section of the site and one other part&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ...&amp;nbsp;which is the &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; change around here.  I&#39;ve recoded the publications section of the site: &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;consequently.org/writing&lt;/a&gt; is now your one-stop-repository for everything academic of mine to hit print.  This used to be a pain to code by hand, and when I caught wind of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/07/16/rebuilding_a_portfolio.html&#34;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; out there of people using weblog software to power a portfolio site, I thought that it might work for my publications page.  It&#39;s pretty neat the way it works from my side.  Every article/draft/book is a &#34;blog entry&#34; of its own, with a title, publication or draft date, abstract, pointer to a &lt;abbr title=&#34;Portable Document Format&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/abbr&gt; file of the paper (if it exists), and its own &lt;em&gt;comment area&lt;/em&gt;.  That means readers like you can comment on anything I&#39;ve written in the one place where other web browsing readers are likely to find it.  Not that you&#39;d necessarily want to comment on what I&#39;ve written, but I like feedback, and maybe &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of you will feel moved to comment.  I&#39;ll be interested to see what it means when it comes to paper drafts, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pc/&#34;&gt;Next Book Project&lt;/a&gt;, for which I plan to post draft chapters as they&#39;re written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, sit back, relax, leave a comment, download some &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt;, subscribe to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/index.xml&#34;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/snippets/index.xml&#34;&gt;feeds&lt;/a&gt;, and wait for the next update!

      <title>Learning Negation</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Having a young child gives you lots of new examples about language learning and concept acquisition.  (It also provides you with many opportunities for experimentation, but I will set that to one side, for the moment.)  Here is one such example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, I was changing Z&amp;rsquo;s nappy and getting him dressed.  He was in a happy mood, and I asked him if he would like me to tickle him.  He said &lt;em&gt;no, no tickle&lt;/em&gt;.  Not to be deterred, I asked him again, and he responded again in kind.  There is no doubt that children learn to &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;refuse&lt;/em&gt; very early in their development.  Children also learn &lt;em&gt;opposites&lt;/em&gt; quite quickly too.  Z has mastered vary many pairs of opposites, and he knows how to use them to his own advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Z again, rephrasing the question: &lt;em&gt;would you like a &lt;strong&gt;little&lt;/strong&gt; tickle?&lt;/em&gt;  Z knew that he wanted to deny this, and so he went for what he took to be the relevant opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, no, no! &lt;strong&gt;Big&lt;/strong&gt; tickle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the tickling that followed, another lesson was learned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Clouds of War</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have refrained from making any public comment about the coming war with Iraq that Australia is about to enter.  Partly out of general reticence, partly because the whole matter is very depressing, and partly because my own thoughts and feelings are inarticulate.  However, one way to deal with inarticulate thoughts and feelings is to attempt to articulate them, so here I go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with most people, I agree that the Hussein regime is terrible and Iraq would be better off without him.  Along with most people, I agree that a full-scale invasion, with cruise missiles, bombs, tanks, infantry, chemical and biological weapons and the consequent death, carnage and destruction is a &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; outcome.  But none of this is what depresses me most.  What depresses me most is &lt;em&gt;what could have been&lt;/em&gt; and how much more sane what could have been compares with what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had things gone differently, we would have had stronger international institutions.  Instead of the blunt instrument of war and occupation, with all of the historical connotation of western invasions in the region, we would be able to deal with this regime differently. Not just the UN Security Council: that&amp;rsquo;s clearly a blunt instrument too.  What we need is an operative, experienced and powerful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccnow.org/&#34;&gt;international criminal court&lt;/a&gt; and an international criminal justice system. If we had this, Saddam Hussein and his regime could be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.  If we had a robust international judicial system, we would be able to &lt;em&gt;prosecute&lt;/em&gt; criminals and treat them with justice in a way that is also &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; to be just.  The only convincing reasons I have heard for the invasion and occupation of Iraq are actually better reasons for a &lt;em&gt;police action&lt;/em&gt; to detain a criminal and to bring him to justice.  If only we had the institutions and practices in place to make this possible.  Unfortunately, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iccnow.org/html/cassel19990512.html&#34;&gt;neither Iraq nor United States&lt;/a&gt; signed up for the International Criminal Court (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/19/1023864456953.html&#34;&gt;Australia kicked up a bit of a fuss about it&lt;/a&gt;, before eventually signing up) so it appears that they would rather have the bloodshed and confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>“Tantrum”</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/zacharyhelping.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;280&#34; alt=&#34;Zachary at work in the Kitchen&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zachary helping Christine in the Kitchen.  March 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary had a difficult day today, missing his afternoon sleep, and getting a bit cranky as a result.  This evening, as I was cooking dinner for Christine and myself, and supervising Zachary eating his dinner, he decided he&amp;rsquo;d had enough of his meal (i.e., he had fingered it a bit, no more), which he had specifically requested (chicken + vegetable rissole and toast, please), and would much prefer grapes.  The scene continued something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Grapes.  Grapes.  More grapes.&amp;rdquo;  Approaches the refrigerator and opens the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No grapes, Zachary, until you&amp;rsquo;ve had some more of your dinner.  You asked for the chicken, and I think you should eat some more.&amp;rdquo;  Gently shuts the fridge door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No chicken.  Grapes.&amp;rdquo;  Opens fridge door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;No grapes yet, Zachary.  Not until you have had some more chicken.  You asked for the chicken, and I made it for you.&amp;rdquo; (Speaking not quite truthfully, as I had simply reheated the rissole, and toasted and buttered the toast.  Zachary and Christine had done the lions share of making the rissoles a couple of days before.)  Shuts fridge door again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: Falls face down on floor (classic tantrum position), and says in a clear, calm voice, &amp;ldquo;Tantrum.  Tantrum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy&lt;/em&gt;: Quizzically. &amp;ldquo;Are you having a tantrum?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zachary&lt;/em&gt;: Calmly.  &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;  Gets up by himself and returns to his dinner to eat some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he understands his own emotional state this well by the time he is in his teenage years, I should be a very happy father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new picture.  This picture was taken last December on the infamous &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/archives/000107.html&#34;&gt;Williamstown Ferry trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes start next week, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to them, even though preparation has been a bit tight.  I am especially interested to see how my &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161438/pub/&#34;&gt;fourth year honours class&lt;/a&gt; enjoy what I have in store for them.  Hopefully by the time I am done, the students will know a whole lot more, and I will have written the literature review for my next book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachary&amp;rsquo;s chicken-pox spots are fading now, so he is probably past the most infectious stage.  This photo is from the first seriously full-on day of spots, last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;February pictures of Zachary are &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  They were taken on our day trip to the Dandenongs with Uncle Martin.  Zachary was &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image3.html&#34;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image5.html&#34;&gt;keen&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image6.html&#34;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/zachary/2003-02/2003-02-Pages/Image8.html&#34;&gt;straw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for him, and for us, Zack&amp;rsquo;s come down with chicken-pox.  The photos are all pre-pox, so there are no pictures of spots.  Or of &lt;em&gt;fots&lt;/em&gt; as he calls them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2003/02/18/thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2003 11:59:37 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2003/02/18/thoughts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like there are too many thoughts to think and too little time in which to think them.  Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: I really ought to think of a detailed response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophyweblog.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_philosophyweblog_archive.html#89228851&#34;&gt;Brian Weatherson&amp;rsquo;s comments&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/envelopes.pdf&#34;&gt;my two envelopes paper co-authored with Graham&lt;/a&gt;, but that detailed response will have to wait a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, let me write a little enigmatic response while it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ambiguity in asking whether one &amp;lsquo;ought to switch&amp;rsquo; or not.  One answer will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given the process which places money in each envelope.  Another will depend on which action maximises expected utility, given what I know about the process placing money in each envelope.  If the circumstance is as Brian describes (I have envelope A, and the process has resulted $n in A and either $(0.5)n or $2n in envelope B with equal likelihood), then switching will maximise utility expected in sense 2.  If I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I have envelope A or envelope B, and I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know that I have equal probability of having envelope A or having envelope B (and the rest of the process is as Brian describes), then we are indifferent between switching and keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems right to me, but I can&amp;rsquo;t confirm if that&amp;rsquo;s the view of the &lt;em&gt;authors of the paper&lt;/em&gt;, as we haven&amp;rsquo;t met to talk about this one yet.  Graham &lt;a href=&#34;http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/papers.php3&#34;&gt;presented the paper at the ANU&lt;/a&gt; (the subtitle &lt;em&gt;the definitive solution to the two-envelope paradox&lt;/em&gt; was not my idea!) and we have some other comments to work through, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have other pressing business also in the queue, including the final touches on a grant application, referee&amp;rsquo;s reports, overdue book reviews, a too big pile of email to read and preparation for upcoming lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butterfly, at the Zoo, December 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the 2003 redesign for the site.  It&amp;rsquo;s late, if you count calendar years, but it&amp;rsquo;s early, if you count our teaching year.  Classes don&amp;rsquo;t start for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design includes the &amp;lsquo;Snippets&amp;rsquo; section, which will include links I find in day-to-day browsing.  This &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; section will contain photos and longer items of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At least I&#39;ll be prepared for the wet and cool weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz at the Zoo.  January 11, 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place was &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt; with easily more than 4000 people crowded in to the Zoo grounds to hear Don Burrows and Nina Ferro in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zoo.org.au/newspage.cfm?p=314&amp;CFID=620970&amp;CFTOKEN=6628730&#34;&gt;Zoo Twilights&lt;/a&gt; music program.  They were in good form, and a fine night was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Notice the relatively low cost of outright &lt;em&gt;inconsistency&lt;/em&gt; compared to nearly everything else.  That warms my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics is just plain &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand it at all, partly because of the strange nature of the &lt;em&gt;probabilities&lt;/em&gt; in QM.  They certainly seem to fit observation (so physicists say), but what do they &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  Well, &lt;em&gt;it just might be&lt;/em&gt; that they are traditional probabilities after all.  That is, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.phys.uu.nl/~thooft/&#34;&gt;Gerard &amp;rsquo;t Hooft&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a new deterministic interpretation of QM which makes sense of all of the numbers.  &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; has an &lt;a href=&#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nature.com/nsu/030106/030106-6.html&#34;&gt;elementary article&lt;/a&gt; about it, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/quant-ph/0212095&#34;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; is available for the hard-core physicists among you.  It looks neat from here, but as I have said, I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the details.  Those of you who do, let me know: does this account avoid the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/HiddenVariables.html&#34;&gt;usual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/#hv&#34;&gt;objections&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;ldquo;hidden variables&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brett Lee in Action</title>

&lt;p&gt;Brett Lee in delivery stride at the MCG today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was spent at the MCG, on the second day of the Boxing Day Test.  My brother, my nephew and I spent a delightful day soaking up the atmosphere, enjoying some fine batting (especially Justin Langer and Martin Love) and some fine bowling (each of McGrath, Gillespie, MacGill and Lee were in dangerous form).  The fact that all of the good performances were from the one team meant that the competition was not as balanced as you would like, but you can&amp;rsquo;t ask for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the cricket live is a very different activity to simply watching it on TV or listening to the radio.  It&amp;rsquo;s more of an &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; for one thing.  You get to choose what you&amp;rsquo;ll focus your attention on, and, in some ways, there is much &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; information available to you than when watching it on the box &amp;ndash; despite the manifold graphs and charts and tables you find on the TV.  In the crowd you hear the reactions of the rest of the crowd.  You feel just how &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; the bowling is (at least, Brett Lee at 150km/h) and how &lt;em&gt;skilled&lt;/em&gt; the reactions of the batsmen are.  We were watching from roughly side-on in the Olympic Stand (at around 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock on the dial) and you get a very good impression of just how far back the wicketkeeper stands when facing a fast bowler.  It was fun.  I&amp;rsquo;ll do that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I just found a very insightful &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=3949&#34;&gt;interview with Philip Pullman&lt;/a&gt;, the author of the &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt; trilogy.  I haven&#39;t read the trilogy yet, but I probably will before I get to Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk&#34;&gt;Third Way&lt;/a&gt;, the mob who published the interview, produce some of the best (Christian) theologically informed social comment around.  Sadly, that&#39;s not saying very much, given the quality of most Christian writing, but Third Way is still very good.  Their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk&#34;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; is worth a browse.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;em&gt;Third Way&lt;/em&gt; predates New Labour, the rise of Tony Blair and the articulation of &#34;Third Way&#34; Politics &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lse.ac.uk/Giddens/FAQs.htm#Third%20way%20politics&#34;&gt;by Anthony Giddens&lt;/a&gt; by many years.  The magazine was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thirdway.org.uk/in/history.asp&#34;&gt;launched in 1977&lt;/a&gt;, significantly predating the reformation of the British Labour Party.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have to let you know that I really don&#39;t enjoy marking first year logic exams.  I love teaching the subject, but the marking is just a hard slog.  And it&#39;s depressing in the cases of failures.  The bright spots are the cases of really excellent work.  But the tedium is pretty tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

It makes breakfast newspaper reading enjoyable.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308573168.html&#34;&gt;Here is one example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lehmann will be popular with spectators because he is an antidote to the prevailing fashion, a throwback to the days of blue-collar cricketers. As far as this column knows, he spends his evenings reading long-winded novels, eating carrots and sipping fizzy water but he does manage to create the impression of a man with a more colourful range of recreational interests.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More&amp;rsquo;s the pity that the cricket itself may not be able to sustain so much interest, with  contest &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/news/sport/cricket/2002/11/item20021110211921_1.htm&#34;&gt;so uneven&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad that my tickets for the MCG test are for the second day, and not the fourth or fifth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Be sure to gaze at the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-bcs.mit.edu/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html&#34;&gt;checkershadow illusion&lt;/a&gt;.  Go now, then come back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cursory check with a little computer program I have (&lt;tt&gt;Digital Color Meter&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;/Applications/Utilities/&lt;/tt&gt; for those of you with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&#34;&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt;) verifies that the two squares which look so different are, in fact, the same 42% grey.  But the surely don&#39;t look the same.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-bcs.mit.edu/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html&#34;&gt;explanation is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=1&#34;&gt;Zoo&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday afternoon.  It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; busy, dodging all of the other prams and strollers.  The zoo is only a couple of minutes (drive) away from our place: it&amp;rsquo;s halfway between our house and the university.  So, we&amp;rsquo;ve become &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zoo.org.au/FOTZ/&#34;&gt;Friends of the Zoo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s great to visit during the week, when it&amp;rsquo;s much quieter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of updates lately.  We&#39;ve been slowly settling in to Melbourne.  Zack loves his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/childcare/centres/qbcontact.html&#34;&gt;childcare&lt;/a&gt;, but settling in has meant a range of new infections in quick succession.  (Conjunctivitis, a severe ear infection and gastroenteritis.)  The latter, he managed to give to me, and this has meant that I now have new insight into the etymology of the term &amp;ldquo;wretched.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, here are a few highlights of recent weeks. First, &lt;a href=&#34;http://webraft.its.unimelb.edu.au/161115/pub/&#34;&gt;my logic students&lt;/a&gt; (they&#39;re bright and enthusiastic), the logic seminars we&#39;ve run each Friday for the last few weeks (it&#39;s &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; to be in a place where we have the critical mass to sustain a regular seminar), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bellshakespeare.com.au/&#34;&gt;Bell Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt; production of &lt;em&gt;The Comedy of Errors&lt;/em&gt; (in the pre-play warmup when the magician &lt;em&gt;Pinch&lt;/em&gt; was doing a range of tricks, he used my jacket for one---the ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll make you think I&amp;rsquo;ve put this knife through your nice jacket&amp;rdquo; trick), and today&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Father&#39;s Day&lt;/em&gt; extravaganza, featuring nice presents (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/06/1019441476677.html&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sidsaustralia.org.au/mos/vic/melbforkids/melbkids2.htm&#34;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1864367350/&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt;) and a wonderful breakfast, and a Zachary who slept in until 7:30am!  Things are &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is seriously elegant: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/08/science/08MATH.html&#34;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt;, three Indian mathematicians have shown that you can test primality (deterministically) in polynomial time.  That&#39;s incredible.  More incredible, I seem to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/news/primality.html&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Moving house is tiring.  Moving house with a young child is exciting, but very tiring.  Moving house to a new city, and rewiring your brain to cope with the changes in weather, shopping, driving, childcare, work, and the innumerable other habits which need to be unlearned and relearned, is very very tiring.  Moving house and waiting five days for your personal effects to catch up with you is not so much &lt;em&gt;tiring&lt;/em&gt; as extremely frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we&#39;re here in Melbourne, we&#39;re happy, and we&#39;re settling in.&lt;/p&gt;

It is to my eternal dismay that Don passed away before I was a postgraduate student in Philosophy at Queensland, because I would have loved talking with him about this material.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Success!  We&#39;ll soon be signing a lease to live in this house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://consequently.org/images/NewPlace.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; alt=&#34;Our New Place&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a sweet three bedroom cottage, with a little backyard and front garden.  Room enough for visitors, so come and visit sometime.  We move in when we arrive in Melbourne: in around two week&#39;s time.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;(I never thought I&#39;d live in a house with a picket fence, but there you go.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Househunting by remote</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2002/06/05/househunting_by_remote/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2002/06/05/househunting_by_remote/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m spending most of my time and emotional energy finding a place to live in Melbourne.  It&#39;s now &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to do a fair bit of this at a distance, due to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realestate.com.au/&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; listing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realestateview.com.au/&#34;&gt;available properties&lt;/a&gt;, but of course you have to be there to inspect properties.  Timing, as usual, is &lt;em&gt;almost everything&lt;/em&gt;.  In this business &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; is also almost everything.  It follows that timing overlaps a great deal with money&amp;mdash;which has been noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m flying down to Melbourne this weekend to take a personal look at a few rental properties, and hopefully to place a bond on a suitable one.  Given that we move in 3 weeks&#39; time, I&#39;ll be spending less time online until we&#39;re up and settled in our new home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does biography (of philosophers) have to do with philosophy</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2002/06/05/what_does_biography_of_philosophers_have_to_do_with_philosophy/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A helpful summary &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i39/39a01601.htm&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com&#34;&gt;Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on the proliferation of biographies of philosophers.  The central question is whether biography of philosophers illuminates the philosophy itself.  Lots of people say there&#39;s nothing one can say about there other.  Others say that all philosophy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; biography.  Here&#39;s one case where I steer a middle path.  I&#39;m beginning to see the value of philosophical biography, as a part of a larger enterprise: the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; of philosophy.  History of philosophy is beginning a resurgance, and with good reason.  Often by looking back to see the context in which an idea/concept/argument/trope was introduced, you see more clearly how it operates and how it is currently used.  Philosophical &lt;em&gt;biography&lt;/em&gt; is an important component of the history of philosophy itself.&lt;/p&gt;

This is Very Nice.  The first really &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; international conference I ever attended  to was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uniovi.es/Congresos/2003/DLMPS/Earlier/Welcome.htm&#34;&gt;10th LMPS Congress in Florence&lt;/a&gt; in 1995 (I was a postdoc then), and I had a truly wonderful time.  I gave an early version of my &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/publications.html#negrl&#34;&gt;Negation in Relevant Logic&lt;/a&gt;&#34; as a &#34;contributed paper&#34;.  It&#39;s a great honour to be one of the invited lecturers (not least because invited lectures get a slot of around an hour, and contributed ones go for around 15 minutes!) and I&#39;m delighted to get the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;... the Internet radically redefines a person&#39;s psychological relationship to time and space. Attention is rivetted on what is tangible, useful, instantly available; the stimulus for deeper thought and reflection may be lacking. Yet human beings have a vital need for time and inner quiet to ponder and examine life and its mysteries, and to grow gradually into a mature dominion of themselves and of the world around them. [&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/communications/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_20020122_world-communications-day_en.html&#34;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was from the &lt;em&gt;Pope&lt;/em&gt;, in a message urging the Church to get into the internet (but to also beware of its limitations).  David Weinberger has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/archive/2002_05_01_archive.html#85081552&#34;&gt;interesting response&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the difference between seeing &lt;em&gt;proclaiming a message&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;engaging in conversation&lt;/em&gt;.  The Holy Father seems keen on the former, without showing much enthusiasm for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;stamp&#34;&gt;What is it with the &#34;parchment&#34; background image on Papal pages on the net?  It looks kitsch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The current ASIO bill before federal parliament is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/02/1019441397890.html&#34;&gt;very big worry&lt;/a&gt;.  No-one should be allowed to arbitrarily detain people on suspicion of &lt;em&gt;having contact with&lt;/em&gt; a member of an what has simply been designated by the Attorney General as a terrorist organisation.  As an academic who regularly comes into contact with hundreds of students on a daily basis, it follows that I could be detained at the whim of the security organisation, if this bill were to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do ASIO want such powers? Or rather, why do the current government want to give these powers to them?  The proximate explanation for this power is so that people in contact with &#34;suspected terrorists&#34; may be detained so as to not inform them of a possible attempt at arrest.  Clearly such draconian and undemocratic powers aren&#39;t necessary for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; outcome. This ought to make us worry about what the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; reason might be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t normally spend my time worrying about the monopolistic practices of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/&#34;&gt;that software company&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25085.html&#34;&gt;this case&lt;/a&gt; is too bizarre to go unremarked.  In a nutshell, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/education/?id=DonatedComputers&#34;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft explain that if a computer is donated to a school, it&#39;s a &lt;em&gt;legal requirement&lt;/em&gt; that the original software installed on the computer be donated with it.  Notice that they agree that the school can &lt;em&gt;upgrade&lt;/em&gt; the software on the computer to another version of Windows.  Why, then, should the school not accept computers which have been previously upgraded with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.freebsd.org/&#34;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux.org&#34;&gt;operating&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/&#34;&gt;system&lt;/a&gt;?  When is an upgrade allowed, and when is it not?&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone agrees that universities are underfunded, but there is not a whole lot of agreement about what to do about it.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dest.gov.au/crossroads/pubs.htm&#34;&gt;recent discussion paper&lt;/a&gt;, flagging increased deregulation for public universities, has sparked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/lm/stories/s541198.htm&#34;&gt;some debate&lt;/a&gt;.  I notice a change in my own reaction to these things, as I move from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mq.edu.au/&#34;&gt;middle-ranking university&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;one set to benefit from any deregulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Banned from the casinos, Blaise rolled up huge debts with illegal existentialists, who set arbitrary odds and paid off arguments on a whim. After losing three times in a week to the idea that all of human consciousness is the precocious hallucination of a disembodied llama brain in a mad sorcerer&#39;s laboratory, Blaise began to despair, and I knew I had to help him.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Zack is learning &lt;em&gt;object permanence&lt;/em&gt;.  Just now he&amp;rsquo;s spent a couple of delightful minutes putting 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aardman.com/wallaceandgromit/homesweethome/shaun/index.shtml&#34;&gt;Shaun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/5104/&#34;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://members.aol.com/IoneDeGraf/&#34;&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt; on a cupboard shelf, closing the door.  Waiting a while, opening the door, smiling, picking up Shaun, closing the door, then opening it again and repeating the process.  Ad infinitum.  I think he&#39;s getting the point that Shaun is still there, even if the door is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that this is done, he&#39;s taking my black pen, putting it up on the desk out of his sight, but in his reach, waiting a while, then picking it up again and repeating the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&#34;The text is wonderfully clear and avoids the tedium of many introductory logic texts. The examples, exercises, and suggestions for further reading are all good. This is the only introductory text I know of that introduces students to some of the philosophical problems logic pertains to and intersects with. It is the type of book I would like to use for an introductory course and recommend it enthusiastically.&#34;  &amp;mdash;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=860&#34;&gt;Michael Hallett, Philosophy Department, McGill University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
