      <title>Why no comments?</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/no-comments/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2015 09:52:39 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/no-comments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Previous incarnations of this website provided a facility for comments in the usual way for a weblog in the first decade of the 2000s&amp;mdash;a comment form on each entry. This one doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Comment forms are ugly. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time &lt;em&gt;moderating comments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;wading through yet another medium that&amp;rsquo;s 90% spam is  not a good way for me to use my time or energy. Publically available comment forms on the web are mostly buckets for spam and other detritus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, there are &lt;em&gt;plenty of other ways&lt;/em&gt; you can comment on anything I do here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;reply to me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Use your favourite twitter client and post a link to news item you&amp;rsquo;re discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include the reference to my twitter handle &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;@consequently&lt;/a&gt;,  or if you simply link to a page on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ll see your reply when I check twitter. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy for me to include tweets in posts, like this one &amp;hellip; &lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-star logic workshop in Banff, 2007 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TT?src=hash&#34;&gt;#TT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&#34;&gt;http://t.co/0qBKXxfyyl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/yMX8yHufgn&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yMX8yHufgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Richard Zach (@RrrichardZach) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RrrichardZach/status/558299627569836032&#34;&gt;January 22, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &amp;hellip; so if you&amp;rsquo;d like to comment, that&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get a short message out, in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, if you&amp;rsquo;ve got something that&amp;rsquo;s longer than a tweet&amp;rsquo;s worth, write it, make it available on the web, and let me know. If I get useful feedback in public, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to link to it on the page, or point readers to it on twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you could always just &lt;a href=&#34;#about&#34;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>What’s the point of a personal website these days?</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/the-point/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 23:05:00 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2015/the-point/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My last post to &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org&#34;&gt;consequently.org&lt;/a&gt; was in late in 2010, well over four years ago. You&amp;rsquo;d be &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; in thinking that I&amp;rsquo;d abandoned the site&amp;mdash;but you&amp;rsquo;d also be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with the site behind the scenes. The software I&amp;rsquo;d been using to maintain the site has long since &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TwP/webby&#34;&gt;fallen into disrepair&lt;/a&gt;, so updating the site meant porting everything to another content management system. At least, it would have to mean that, given that I &lt;em&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; really keen to burn the whole thing to the ground and start again from scratch. This required &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t require &lt;em&gt;four years&lt;/em&gt;, but it did require an uninterrupted stretch of time to tinker with software, experiment with the design, and finally, piece everything back together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before getting back into all of this website business, however, I wanted to answer one question. Is the investment of time worth it? &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the point of a personal website these days, anyway&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, people can &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;find me on twitter&lt;/a&gt;, where you might find a brief remark or more each week. (Or you might find &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23advent%20OR%20%23adventure%20OR%20%23christmas%20from%3Aconsequently%20since%3A2014-11-30%20until%3A2014-12-27&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;virtual “advent calendar”&lt;/a&gt; when I&amp;rsquo;m a bit more adventurous.) I occasionally &lt;a href=&#34;http://instagram.com/consequently&#34;&gt;post photos on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see me there if you like that sort of thing. You can find (most of) &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfBBS7AAAAAJ&#34;&gt;my publications on Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, and you can even find &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;instructional videos I&amp;rsquo;ve made available to the public on Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. You can even join in with &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic1&#34;&gt;classes I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://coursera.org/course/logic2&#34;&gt;teach (with Jen Davoren) on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, and you can use &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org&#34;&gt;philevents.org&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://philevents.org/search/index/searchForm?span=PAST&amp;amp;customTag=&amp;amp;speakers%5B0%5D.id=1176&amp;amp;autonamespeaker=Greg+Restall&amp;amp;series=&amp;amp;search=true&amp;amp;hits=&amp;amp;widget=&amp;amp;Search=Search&#34;&gt;keep track of talks I&amp;rsquo;ve given&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve  been inactive on the web, even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been leaving a much of a trace &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; lately. Isn&amp;rsquo;t all that web presence enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it isn&amp;rsquo;t. At least, it isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me in 2015. Let me explain why, by turning to the different sections of this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; section keeps track of all of my academic publications. Where I can, I archive pre- or post-publication versions of my papers, and sometimes I upload versions of papers here &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; submission, to get the ideas out as quickly as possible, and to get feedback. I could do that without having my own website. (&lt;a href=&#34;http://philpapers.org&#34;&gt;Philpapers.org&lt;/a&gt; is a great way for people to upload draft papers in philosophy, for example.) But at your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; site, you can present yourself however you see fit, and you can make it easy for people to find your work. You provide a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; for  aggregators to aggregate. That&amp;rsquo;s one reason to take control of your own body of work. As long as the HTTP protocol keeps going, I can host my own work and people can find it. &lt;em&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;philpapers&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;journal websites&lt;/em&gt; can come or go. As long as people can get here, they can keep track of my work. If someone asks how to keep up with what I write, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where I&amp;rsquo;ll point them. A &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; I control: &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;Classes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; sections of the website were more pressing for me, though, as I thought about why it was important to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;room of one&amp;rsquo;s own&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the web. I&amp;rsquo;ve been making more of my &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; resources available to the public, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gregrestall&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/consequently/&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. While I use our campus &lt;a href=&#34;https://lms.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;LMS&lt;/a&gt; to distribute materials to my on-campus students, that&amp;rsquo;s basically walled off to non-students. I can&amp;rsquo;t point non-Melbourne students to that if I want to give them access to teaching resources, or simply to catch up on what I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching. I&amp;rsquo;d like to have somewhere to do that. So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/class&#34;&gt;http://consequently.org/class&lt;/a&gt; will serve as a directory of all my recent and future teaching resources—at least, all of the resources I&amp;rsquo;ll be making freely available to everyone, and it can be a straightforward first port-of-call for anyone who wants to check out a class I teach, to see if it interests them. Teaching is a very important part of what I do, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to spread this material far and wide if it will help others. I think it will help me, too: the more opportunities for feedback on teaching materials I get, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation&#34;&gt;Presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The same holds for &lt;em&gt;talks&lt;/em&gt; I give. I&amp;rsquo;d like there to be a simple, stable URL for each talk, whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/towards-fixed-point-models-logicmelb/&#34;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/trmra-asubl5/&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/cemd-anu/&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/christian-academic-monash/&#34;&gt;different&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/tractatus-masterclass/&#34;&gt;kind of presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to put materials from talks online, and sometimes I won&amp;rsquo;t. But in any case, I want to have an archive of recent and upcoming talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news&#34;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; section of the website, which can be the home for not-academic pieces of writing which don&amp;rsquo;t fit well into &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;140 character&lt;/a&gt; chunks, and which don&amp;rsquo;t find a place in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;more considered pieces&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; These are pieces of writing like &lt;em&gt;this very discussion&lt;/em&gt;. While some find places like &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; a suitable home for longer-than-twitter online writing, I&amp;rsquo;m fond of &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/catarinadutilhnovaes/&#34;&gt;people&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umsu.de/wo/&#34;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://kjhealy.org&#34;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m itching to get back into it, with some occasional writing of my own, to supplement more considered academic pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of my return to this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s end with the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;. The short answer is what you see in the footer of the website (as I write this). &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is the CMS that wires things together into the website. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, relatively straightforward to learn if you&amp;rsquo;re used to command-line tools, and can it cope with the not-completely-straightforward taxonomy of my site. Hugo seems to be under active development by its founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/spf13/&#34;&gt;Steve Francia&lt;/a&gt; together with an active &lt;a href=&#34;http://discuss.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; of users and developers. It looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hand-coded the HTML (designing it to be &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; friendly for small-screen devices) using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com/kube/&#34;&gt;Kube Web Framework&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://imperavi.com&#34;&gt;Imperavi&lt;/a&gt;. (Please let me know if you see any website design bugs.) The main body and header font is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Alegreya&lt;/a&gt;, a gorgeous font designed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/juandelperal&#34;&gt;Juan Pablo del Peral&lt;/a&gt; for the Argentinian Type Foundry &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huertatipografica.com&#34;&gt;Huerta Tipogr&amp;aacute;fica&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya&#34;&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;. Apply liberal doses of &lt;a href=&#34;http://marketlane.com.au&#34;&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cockburnproject.net&#34;&gt;Bruce Cockburn&lt;/a&gt;, a few late nights&amp;rsquo; worth of coding, and you get the website you have before you. I hope you like it. Please get back to me, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;replying to @consequently&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, or by email, if you have any feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3.</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2010/11/16/Testing_testing_1,_2,_3/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2010 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2010/11/16/Testing_testing_1,_2,_3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just testing to see if this thing is on.  Yes, it seems to be working.  How about that!? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty rusty, but apparently this site still works. That&amp;rsquo;s good to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few items of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been way too busy coordinating the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Philosophy program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Melbourne to be posting here. It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy ride for the year, but it&amp;rsquo;s been fantastic. It looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be in the saddle again for 2011, so hopefully having learned how to hold the reins this year, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to post here a little more next year.  No promises though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing. Doing lots of writing.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few changes on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; page. I&amp;rsquo;m most happy with the new paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;A Cut-Free Sequent System for Two-Dimensional Modal Logic: and why it matters&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s a little philosophy there, and a little proof theory, too. It&amp;rsquo;s not too long (just 24 pages), and I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate your comments. Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/cfss2dml/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt; to download the paper and post your comments.  (Make sure you admire the in-line diagrams on page 16. That&amp;rsquo;s LaTeX, with no postprocessing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next travels involve a trip to Guangzhou to take part in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.helsinki.fi/logic/sellc-2010/&#34;&gt;SELLC 2010&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s going to be a blast, helping teach a Winter School to a bunch of enthusiastic students, and with a great slate of lecturers. It&amp;rsquo;ll be good to catch up with Samson, Robin, Mehrnoosh and Dag, and to meet the rest of the lecturers, as well as my colleagues at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;ILC&lt;/a&gt; at Sun Yat-Sen University.  On the way home from Guangzhou, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick side trip to Boston for the Eastern APA, to contribute to a session on the future of logic, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~horty/&#34;&gt;John Horty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan/&#34;&gt;Johan van Benthem&lt;/a&gt;.  What fun!  This will be my first ever APA, so if you have any advice for an APA neophyte, do let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Time Flies</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/10/20/Time_flies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/10/20/Time_flies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time flies like an arrow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fruit flies like a banana.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;d realise I&amp;rsquo;m still alive.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t think that from the activity &amp;ndash; or lack thereof &amp;ndash; here.  (Though a few papers have appeared &amp;ndash; or changed their publication status &amp;ndash; on my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where we are: It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy, eventful semester, and the teaching period is almost done.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had fun teaching proof theory to fourth-year students, tutoring intro philosophy to first years, and supervising graduate students (at last count, I have eight current research students in various stages of the degrees).  One of the sadder things to befall us here at Melbourne is the departure of Allen Hazen, who as left our shores for the chillier climes of Edmonton.  The Melbourne logic community&amp;rsquo;s loss is Canada&amp;rsquo;s gain here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;m off on a short trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=760&#34;&gt;Guangzhou&lt;/a&gt;, by way of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~arche/events/event?id=212&#34;&gt;St. Andrews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy/department/events/phs_seminars/phs_seminars.html&#34;&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s the long way around, but somebody has got to do it.  I&amp;rsquo;m busy clearing the decks here of as much as I can before the trip.  One of the decks to be cleared is this blog, so a post is in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posting about not posting for a long time is so &lt;em&gt;pass&amp;eacute;&lt;/em&gt;, so here&amp;rsquo;s a link to something you might like if you&amp;rsquo;re a logic person like me.  Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed playing around with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Wandering Mango&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s program &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Mac OS X only).  It&amp;rsquo;s a very neat natural deduction educational tool: it helps you produce valid Fitch-style natural deduction proofs, using the format of the major texts used in intro teaching.  Well, as far as I can tell, they&amp;rsquo;re the major texts ued in intro teaching in North America.  In Australia, in Europe, in the UK, logic is taught in different ways: &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=SFa6AIB1Ct8C&#34;&gt;Smullyan-style tableaux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=2sCuDMUruSUC&#34;&gt;Gentzen tree-style natural deduction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;Lemmon-style linear natural deduction&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;though see the update below&lt;/em&gt;) with labels, etc.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot you need to do if you&amp;rsquo;re going to cover the ground of all the ways of teaching introductory logic by way of &amp;lsquo;proofs&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in touch with the developer, and he tells me this is only the beginning for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;Deductions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s built in a modular fashion, and it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to start extending it to cover more systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you teach logic, or if you&amp;rsquo;re learning logic and you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn it by having a proof assistant on side to keep your proofs on track &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wanderingmango.com/videos.html&#34;&gt;take a look at &lt;em&gt;Deductions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update on December 8, 2009&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sfu.ca/~jeffpell/&#34;&gt;Jeff Pelletier&lt;/a&gt; reminds me in an email that Lemmon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=PSXdSp29LZKWlQTMzqCeAQ&#34;&gt;beginning logic&lt;/a&gt; was not the first to introduce what I called &amp;lsquo;Lemmon-style&amp;rsquo; linear natural deduction. Patrick Suppes, in his &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=jFRwDqpoN2UC&#34;&gt;Introduction to Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. For more on ths history of natural deduction, a great place to start is Jeff&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfu.ca/~jeffpell/papers/NDHistory.pdf&#34;&gt;A Brief History of Natural Deduction&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Thanks for that, Jeff!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Posting has been light, since I&amp;rsquo;ve been powering through work at the end of the semester, and getting ready for a quick trip west to Europe, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~ncm/&#34;&gt;Non-Classical Mathematics 2009&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=1297&#34;&gt;Logica 2009&lt;/a&gt;, preceded by a quick &lt;a href=&#34;http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/philosophische_fakultaet/iph/termine/vortrag_restall&#34;&gt;visit to Dresden&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tu-dresden.de/phfiph/prof/lowiphil/hwa.htm&#34;&gt;Heinrich Wansing&lt;/a&gt;, and to break up the train trip from Frankfurt to Prague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, posting here has paused for a bit, but now that I&amp;rsquo;m settled in Hejnice and that there&amp;rsquo;s a wireless connection here, I can deal with some of my backlog of things I&amp;rsquo;ve promised to post.  So, here&amp;rsquo;s a salad of links for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Faculty, the Arts Faculty, at the University of Melbourne, is holding a short &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;Winter School&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;July 15 and 16&lt;/em&gt;, for students from Ausralia (but outside Victoria), to come and get a taste of the range of research done in the Faculty.  If you&amp;rsquo;re from inside Australia but outside Victoria, you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;high achieving honours student&amp;rsquo;, and you&amp;rsquo;d like a trip to Melbourne to see what we do, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/futurestudents/research/winter-school.html&#34;&gt;please apply&lt;/a&gt;.  Applications close June 22, so you&amp;rsquo;ve got to be quick!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m helping organise &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/iclc2009/&#34;&gt;ICLC2009&lt;/a&gt;, the Intenational Conference on Logic and Cognition at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, held from &lt;em&gt;November 2 to 4, 2009&lt;/em&gt;. The deadline for getting your paper in for this conference is a leisurely &lt;em&gt;October 1, 2009&lt;/em&gt;.  Guangzhou is great (&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2008/11/14/off_to_guangzhou/&#34;&gt;I was there last year&lt;/a&gt; and had a wonderful time at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/&#34;&gt;Institute for Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;), and if you can come along, please do &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/ICLC2009/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=757&#34;&gt;submit a paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Griffin and Bernard Linsky are hosting &lt;a href=&#34;http://pm100.mcmaster.ca/&#34;&gt;PM@100&lt;/a&gt;, a conference on the 100th Anniversary of the publication of &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt;. That conference is from &lt;em&gt;21&amp;ndash;24 May, 2010&lt;/em&gt; at McMaster University in Ontario, and paper submissions are due only on &lt;em&gt;January 1, 2010&lt;/em&gt;, so for this you have more time to get things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no deadline at all for joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;Friends of the SEP Society&lt;/a&gt;.  Are you a Friend of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu&#34;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;?  So many of us &amp;ndash; students, academics, interested readers &amp;ndash; use it for our research, and it&amp;rsquo;s a great resource for everyone.  If you&amp;rsquo;re a regular user of the SEP (and if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in philosophy, who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be?), consider joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/&#34;&gt;the Society&lt;/a&gt; to help support the work of the Encyclopedia.  For a small fee, you support the encyclopedia, you help it keep up its mission of free, high quality introductions to philosophical themes &amp;ndash; and you get access to great quality PDF versions of the entries in the SEP, which are just ideal for printing out and reading (and annotating) offline.  You also (if you like) get email notifications whenever the articles you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded get updated.  It&amp;rsquo;s a good deal, and it&amp;rsquo;s much cheaper (at US$25 a year for a full subscription, down to US$5 a year for a student subscription) than a journal subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll get back to posting on more substantial things later.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a conference to attend. For little quips along the way, you can follow the &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rumfitt on Multiple Conclusions, Part 2</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/02/Rumfitt_Part_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/02/Rumfitt_Part_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is Part 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;a series of comments&lt;/a&gt; on Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84).  In &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I focussed on Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s direct criticism of my approach in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; and I tried to show that his criticism missed the mark, and that it missed the mark in an important way. The norms of logical consequence and logical coherence apply not only to occurrent beliefs but to all manner of states of accepting and rejecting (or acts of assertion and denial), whether they express our deep standing beliefs or hypotheses we simply entertain lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part, I want to consider the comments on the possibility of genuine &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt; with multiple conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rumfitt writes (and I&amp;rsquo;ll quote him at some length here), on page 79:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rarity, to the point of extinction, of naturally occurring multiple-conclusion arguments has always been the reason why mainstream logicians have dismissed multiple-conclusion logic as little more than a curiosity. (See e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Taming-True-Neil-Tennant/dp/0198237170/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Tennant 1997&lt;/a&gt;, 320.) And attempts by enthusiasts to alleviate the embarrassment here have often ended up compounding it. In the introduction to their textbook on the subject, Shoesmith and Smiley concede that multiple-conclusion proofs can scarcely be said to form part of the everyday repertoire of mathematics. &amp;lsquo;Perhaps the nearest one comes to them&amp;rsquo;, they go on, &amp;ldquo;is in proof by cases, where one argues &amp;ldquo;suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; &amp;hellip; suppose &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; then &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;; but &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &amp;hellip; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. A diagrammatic representation of this argument exhibits the downward branching which we shall see is typical of formalised multiple-conclusion proofs &amp;hellip; But the ordinary proof by cases is at best a degenerate form of multiple-conclusion argument, for the different conclusions are all the same (in our example they are all instances of the same formula &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;rdquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley 1978&lt;/a&gt;, 4–5). &amp;ldquo;At best degenerate&amp;rdquo;, though, hardly says it. I do not know how the word &amp;ldquo;multiple&amp;rdquo; is used in Cambridge, but in the rest of the English-speaking world it is understood to mean &amp;ldquo;more than one&amp;rdquo;. So an example of an argument in which all the conclusions (&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;) are identical provides little justification for taking multiple-conclusion logic seriously. But since this is all that Shoesmith and Smiley provide by way of a positive case for deeming their system to be a branch of logic, readers of their book may be forgiven for closing it with a sigh on reaching p. 5 of the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, in defence of Shoesmith and Smiley, the one example of proof by cases (in which the intermediate formula are all the same) is not the only consideration they provide in favour of taking their system to be a branch of logic.  Showing that it is a codification of a notion of (let&amp;rsquo;s call it) &lt;em&gt;quasi&lt;/em&gt;-proof which delivers logical consequence on Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequents, and which, when restricted to single conclusion deductions agrees with traditional natural deduction should count for something.  If it&amp;rsquo;s not a branch of logic, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a single case where the only multiple conclusions aren&amp;rsquo;t very multiple is not very satisfying. But there is a genuine sense, of course, in which even in this case the conclusions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; multiple.  Surely they have heard of the type&amp;ndash;token distinction outside of Cambridge?  There is a perfectly admissible sense in which the rule of conjunction introduction (in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s natural deduction) requires &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; premises, even when the instance used is a derivation of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; from the premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.  (To rewrite this to be a proof from one instance of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; may radically change the structure of the proof, especially if both instances of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; are proved in very different ways.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is a minor point, not worth any more of our time.  More important is the way that Rumfitt missed what is going on in proofs by cases.  I don&amp;rsquo;t mind that he missed my example of a proof featuring multiple conclusions, discussed in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on page 199 to address just the point Rumfitt raised here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose everyone is either happy or tired. Choose a person. It follows that this person is either happy or tired. There are two cases. Case (i) this person is happy. Case (ii) this person is tired, and as a result someone is tired. As a result, either this person is happy or someone (namely that person) is tired. But the person we chose was arbitrary, so either everyone is happy or someone is tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to me to be perfectly valid reasoning: It&amp;rsquo;s a proof.  It&amp;rsquo;s a renderng in (somewhat) natural language of a sequent derivation of &amp;ldquo;everything is an &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or something is a &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  (For the sequent derivation I used, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions&#34;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this proof, there are two conclusions active at a number of points.  Stop the proof before the sentence starting &amp;ldquo;As a result&amp;rdquo;.  Consider the state of play at this point in the derivation.  We have a proof from &amp;ldquo;Everyone is either happy or tired&amp;rdquo; to the two conclusions: &amp;ldquo;Case (i) &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is happy.&amp;rdquo; (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is an eigenvariable standing for &amp;lsquo;that person&amp;rsquo;, which in turn points back to the choice made after the supposition.)  &amp;ldquo;Case (ii) someone is tired.&amp;rdquo;  In other words, we have a proof corresponding to the sequent (everything is either &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;Fa&lt;/em&gt;, something is &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot think of any way of understanding the deduction up to that point in such a way as to (a) see it as a single deduction, and (b) not introduce irrelevant connectives not explicitly used in the text.  This example seems to me to be strong evidence that one can find in nature real-life uses of multiple conclusions in action, if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know where to look, you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need tricky cases of intuitionistically invalid arguments to make the point.  The point is there in Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; examples of proof by cases.  If you stop a proof by cases (in the middle of the ellipses eliding the interesting bits of the subproofs, in the bit of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith &amp;amp; Smiley&lt;/a&gt; quoted by Rumfitt) you will get more interesting cases where the conclusions in play differ.  For example, take this proof of (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;). (Ignore the bracketed markers [a], [b] and [c] for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  Then it follows that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  It follows that &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  So, we have two cases: (i) &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and (ii) &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [a] Consider case (i).  Here, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  Consider case (ii). Here, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and we already have &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, so &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;. [b].  Back in case (i), it follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).  In (ii), it also follows that (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) [c].  So, we conclude, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this seems to me to be perfectly understandable reasoning.  The point at which Rumfitt jokes about &amp;lsquo;multiple&amp;rsquo; instances of the conclusion &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; corresponds to our point [c], where we have proved the conclusion (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;or; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) in each case, but have not yet drawn them together to a single conclusion in the argument.  True, at this point we have a proof with two instances of the one concluding formula.  This is no better or worse than a proof with two instances of the one premise formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But [c] is only one place to stop the proof.  Suppose we pause at point [b].  What do we have there?  It&amp;rsquo;s a proof from one premise &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;), leading to two cases, one in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, and the other in which we&amp;rsquo;ve proved &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  This corresponds to the sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, and the two concluding formulas are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me confess: I engineered this case by interleaving the two cases in the text, to get to an intermediate step in both of them.  But this does not render the case any less salient.  I could have stopped at point [a], and here, what we have got to is a sequent &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rArr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;.  In other words, we have just got to the point at which the disjunction is broken up into two cases, and each case is ready for further processing using the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the core idea of multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;natural deduction&lt;/em&gt;.  The disjunction rule can be understood simply, as taking us from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; to the two conclusions &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;,  which can then be operated on as usual, in the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; proof.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t like this, that&amp;rsquo;s fine.  However, that is not an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion structures can&amp;rsquo;t be found in natural reasoning.  They are there if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few days I&amp;rsquo;ll post a response to what I take to be the most interesting of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s arguments, his considerations against the Cut Rule.  But that, I suspect, will take a little more time, and other duties are pressing for the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, comments on these ideas are most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;Thanks to Ole Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been alerted to Ian Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;Knowledge by Deduction&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Grazer Philosophische Studien&lt;/em&gt;, vol. 77 (2008) pp. 61&amp;ndash;84.).  In it, he makes a number of critical comments on multiple conclusion accounts of logical consequence, and in particular, he makes some critical remarks on my paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  Now, the criticism of mutiple conclusion consequence isn&amp;rsquo;t the main point of the paper&amp;mdash;the main topic is how one can acquire knowlege by deduction, as the title indicates. On that topic, it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting paper, and I hope to comment on those parts at some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since the paper ends with the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have found reason to leave multiple-conclusion logics to the boy racers, and focus on the single-conclusion rules, by following which we can splice together the deliverances of various sources of knowledge to come to know things that we could not know otherwise.  (page 83)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the criticism of multiple conclusion consequence plays a significant role in the paper, and in how Rumfitt thinks of the topic of acquiring knowledge by deduction.  The &amp;lsquo;boy racer&amp;rsquo; image&amp;mdash;which I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is not intended to be flattering to people like me who have advocated multiple conclusion logics&amp;mdash;arises out of an argument to the effect that multiple conclusion logics are finely tuned machines, which are fiddly to maintain, like a sports car.  I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the metaphor for readers to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the criticism I should reply in some kind of public forum, to get a response out there.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem appropriate to write an extensive essay just in response to a few points made in one paper, though I may make the remarks in some other paper I&amp;rsquo;m writing if it is appropriate to the topic at hand.  But I have a weblog, it seems like the appropraite avenue for responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got three comments to make. They are, in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of my &amp;lsquo;overplaying my hand,&amp;rsquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2009/05/its-end-of-logic-as-we-know-it.html&#34;&gt;cited by Ole&lt;/a&gt; in the post that drew my attention to Ian&amp;rsquo;s paper.  This is taken up &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/01/Rumfitt_Part_1/#readon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s point that multiple conclusion deductions aren&amp;rsquo;t found in nature.  (This point is, of course, not limited to Rumfitt.  It&amp;rsquo;s found throughout the literature, predominantly in response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Multiple-Conclusion-Logic-D-J-Shoesmith/dp/0521093325/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Shoesmith and Smiley&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt;.)  This is taken up in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/06/03/Rumfitt_Part_2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting argument concerning the multiple conclusion &lt;em&gt;Cut Rule&lt;/em&gt; being properly stronger than mere transitivity. (This is the point at which the metaphor of the sports car appears.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making all three comments in the one post seems excessive.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll make the first comment here, and leave the other two for later posts in the next little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I can tell you &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; story, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to tell you &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; story.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn&#34;&gt;&amp;darr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;ret&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  What is multiple conclusion consequence?  It is what is presented in Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus for classical logic.  A multiple conclusion consequence links a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of premises &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; with a number (maybe zero, maybe more) of conclusions &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.  We say that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if there&amp;rsquo;s a sequent derivation of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.  The soundness and completeness theorem linking Gentzen&amp;rsquo;s sequent calculus to models for classical logic tells us that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; if and only if there is no model (and assignment of values to the variables, if we allow free variables in &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;) in which each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied and no member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is satisfied.   Formally speaking, multiple conclusion consequence is impeccable when it comes to classical logic, and its fragments such as distributive lattice logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my favoured approach (discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;), the multiple conclusion consequence from &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; makes &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as saying that a position in which every member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is asserted and every member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is denied is self-defeating.  (I&amp;rsquo;ll have more to say about what it is to be self-defeating in the salient sense, below.)  For example, (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) entails &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; and yes, asserting the inclusive disjunction of &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; while at the very same time denying &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; is to make a mistake&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s for the very claims to undercut one another in a very special way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Rumfitt doesn&amp;rsquo;t like this approach. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s explicit criticism of the earliest exposition I have given of the ideas, in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.  He writes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this case for multiple conclusions is presented in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Restall 2005&lt;/a&gt;. But he overplays his hand in suggesting that &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is a multiple-conclusion consequence of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; can be explained as meaning &amp;lsquo;The mental state of accepting all of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and rejecting all of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; would be self-defeating&amp;rsquo;. The mental state that consists of accepting that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo;, while rejecting that very statement, is self-defeating. But &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; is in no sense a consequence of &amp;lsquo;There will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;ldquo;There is a god&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;. (p. 80)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: I just don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s premise in the argument.  I don&amp;rsquo;t agree that accepting (a) that there will never be sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; and (b) rejecting &amp;lsquo;There is a god&amp;rsquo; are jointly self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, (a) and (b) jointly involve doing something for which there will never be sufficient grounds, but &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; not what is required for self-defeat in anything like any of the senses I was discussing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why.  You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice this from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s summary of the position in &amp;ldquo;Multiple Conclusions&amp;rdquo; but I was careful to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; restrict the story of self-defeat (later traded in for the notion of incoherence) to occurrent beliefs or other mental states.  In fact, though I talk about accepting and rejecting in the paper, I was careful to allow that this makes sense even in those cases where we accept claims &lt;em&gt;hypothetically&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;for the sake of the argument&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Suppse &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, I say.  If you&amp;rsquo;re following along, then under the scope of this supposition, you accept &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.   You reaon &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;.  If you also accept &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; then, under this scope, it would be a mistake to reject &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;.  This is clearly something we do, and we want a notion of logical consequence to apply under the scope of such suppositions or hypotheses.  (It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how we could make sense of the rule of conditional proof and what goes on when we reason like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; without some such move.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in this discussion, one should never limit accepting and rejecting to occurrent mental states like belief and disbelief.  That will limit the range of applicability of the notion of logical consequence too much.  This was one reason I used &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo;, and why I was careful to also talk of &amp;lsquo;assertion&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;denial&amp;rsquo;, for one can similarly assert under the scope of a supposition, in a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, consider what we might say about Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case and the position in which I accept that there is not and will never be any sufficient grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;There is a god.&amp;rsquo;  OK. Let&amp;rsquo;s, for the sake of the argument, &lt;em&gt;grant&lt;/em&gt; that.  And let&amp;rsquo;s suppose that we &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; it.  Now, consider this:  I ask you to consider what would be the case if, as a matter of fact, there were a god.  You are quite well within your rights to say that in that case, there would be a god and that despite that fact, there would still be no grounds for accepting or rejecting the claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I think you&amp;rsquo;d be right, and I think that in that discussion, under the scope of that supposition, we have a case where we (conditionally) accept &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo; and accept &amp;lsquo;there is no grounds for accepting or rejecting the statement &amp;lsquo;there is a god&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rsquo; and where we do so completely coherently, with no self-defeat at all.  There is something epistemically defective, of course, in thinking that we are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; such a circumstance as described under that supposition.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not required.  That&amp;rsquo;s the joy of assertion and denial, and of accepting and rejecting.  We can make them fly beyond the limits of what we happen to believe (and disbelieve) at the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t accept the premise of Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s argument: I submit that it&amp;rsquo;s a too-narrow reading of &amp;lsquo;accepting&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;rejecting&amp;rsquo; (not allowing enough to count) and a too-wide reading of &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; (allowing too much to count).  If you understand &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;reject&amp;rsquo; broadly enough&amp;mdash;as I think we must&amp;mdash;then the right notion of self-defeat is much easier to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else do I say about the notion of self-defeat?  In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/s5nets/&#34;&gt;on this&lt;/a&gt; I have not used the term &amp;lsquo;self-defeat&amp;rsquo; for it is too easily confused with epistemic notions of assertion without warrant.  (Lloyd Humberstone pointed out a few years ago in conversation that you might worry about Moore paradoxical sentences on my approach, so I have been aware of this issue for some time.)  Instead, I have used the more abstract terms of art such as involving a &amp;lsquo;clash,&amp;rsquo; being &amp;lsquo;incoherent&amp;rsquo; or being &amp;lsquo;out of bounds&amp;rsquo; when talking about positions [&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;] where &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; entails &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;.   What is involved in such a clash?  The clash in the assertion of each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; and the denial of each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;, whatever it is, is the kind of clash involved in asserting &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and denying &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Its normative force, whatever it is, is not just any old force (like that of asserting something for which there is no evidence, or of denying something true).  The connective rules for the sequent calculus show how &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; clashes can be reduced to this basic clash between assertion and denial of the one thing.  Exactly how that reduction goes, and what one can say about the Cut Rule (which also connects clashes with other clashes), I&amp;rsquo;ll leave for another time.  For now, I hope to have shown that Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s case, and other Moore paradoxical cases, don&amp;rsquo;t cause any concern for the position in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider other points from Rumfitt&amp;rsquo;s interesting article, but that seems like enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  I&amp;rsquo;d value feedback on this, as I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make sure that the position is &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;convincing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;d settle for &lt;em&gt;clearly explained&lt;/em&gt; though I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;fn&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a prize to send to the first person who posts a comment explaining what highbrow cultural reference I just made: the offer is valid for one week, until June 8, 2009.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post the answer if no-one has got it by then. &lt;a href=&#34;#ret&#34;&gt;&amp;uarr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Problems for Naïve Property Theories</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/05/21/problems_for_naive_theories_of_properties/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about generalisations of Russell&amp;rsquo;s paradox, cleaning things up so you can&amp;rsquo;t get around the problem by changing the logic of connectives. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that mucking around with &lt;em&gt;negation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;implication&lt;/em&gt; gets to the heart of the issue.  (This view is shared by some very &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/view?isbn=0262071444&#34;&gt;insightful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11225-009-9177-2&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to it alone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting around negation and conditionals is surprisingly easy, once you get the proof theory sorted out.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been noodling about with this issue for a year or so now.  I presented on this in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;talk at the World Congress of Paraconsistency&lt;/a&gt; last year, and a bit of it has appeared in my draft &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/stp/&#34;&gt;discussion of some themes from Hartry Field&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Saving Truth From Paradox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, the paradoxical derivations are done in sequent calculi, and they&amp;rsquo;re not the most perspicuous presentation.  I managed to sharpen it up a bit tonight, and the resulting proof is &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s not explained in the text of that note: that gives just the definitions and the proof. I hope to get to that soon.  But let me use this site to get the ideas out in a rough and ready form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the idea is this.  Folks like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Graham Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Hartry Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; think that for every description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) there&amp;rsquo;s a property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;).  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).  The traditional problem is this: consider the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t instantiate &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt;.  Does this instantiate itself or not?  If it does, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solutions favoured by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Contradiction-Study-Transconsistent-Graham-Priest/dp/0199263302/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Saving-Truth-Paradox-Hartry-Field/dp/0199230757/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Field&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Beall&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics/&#34;&gt;my&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr&#34;&gt;former self&lt;/a&gt;), though they differ in details, all agree that we should muck around with the logic of negation.  (And also the logic of the conditional, as the property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;: if &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; then I&amp;rsquo;m a monkey&amp;rsquo;s uncle&amp;gt; is just as problematic: see &lt;a href=&#34;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/curry-paradox/&#34;&gt;Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;pain&lt;/em&gt; to worry about each different tweak to the logic of negation and the logic of the conditional, and worry about whether this patch or that fix really does solve the problem.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a fun pain, if you like that kind of thing, but a pain nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at formulations of the problem that avoid all talk of negation, conditionals and other stuff my friends and colleagues can argy bargy about.  Instead, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make do with the logic of instantiation (that&amp;rsquo;s implicit in the so-called na&amp;iuml;ve theory of properties, for which each description &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) has a corresponding  property &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; which is &amp;phi;.  An object &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; instantiates the property  &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; if and only if &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;).)  So, we adopt two inference rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] From &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;) infer &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] From &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; infer &amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for each open sentence &amp;phi;(&amp;nbsp;).  (The &amp;lsquo;&amp;epsilon;&amp;rsquo; is our shorthand for &amp;lsquo;instantiates.&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need two more things.  First, a sentence that is pretty bad.  One from which we can infer everything will do the trick.  (If you have a universal quantifier around, &amp;lsquo;everything instantiates everything&amp;rsquo; will do nicely.  But it isn&amp;rsquo;t mandatory.)  In other words, we have a &amp;lsquo;&amp;perp;&amp;rsquo; for which&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  From &amp;perp; infer any sentence you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need the logic of identity for properties.  You need to have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; account of when &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;phi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;psi;(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;gt; for different sentences &amp;phi; and &amp;psi;.  It&amp;rsquo;d be odd to say that the property of being red and square was a different property from the property of being square and red, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?  (The extant na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties say little about this.  The extant consistency or non-triviality proofs for na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties, alas, make different descriptions denote &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; properties, which is not what you should want.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we say that would rule out out distinctions where there is no difference at all?  What identity condition works for this sort of property?  Extensionality is the identity condition for &lt;em&gt;sets&lt;/em&gt;.  If the things in set &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are the same as the things in set &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are the same set.  That&amp;rsquo;s clearly too strong for properties.  (Think renates and cordates, or featherless bipeds and humans.)  But if I can deduce that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and vice versa (where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is aribtrary), using deduction alone and no contingent side conditions, then what difference could there be between property &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and property &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;?  None that I can see, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure.  This motivates the following condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  If I can deduce &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;, with no other side conditions, discharge those assumptions and infer &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parenthetical remark: that &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; mean that being H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is the same property as being water, unless you think you can infer that &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  from &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is water, and vice versa, using logic alone.  You can think that they are necessarily coextensive without thinking &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;re not identifying properties coarsely.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] tells us when two properties are identical.  We need to know what we can infer from the claim that two properties are identical.  That seems straightforward.  You only get out what you put in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;]  From &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, infer &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s five simple inference principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those five inference principles are enough for you to deduce &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bad, since from &amp;perp; one can validly deduce everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we deduce &amp;perp;?  We use identity and &amp;perp; to do what we wanted negation to do before our friends and colleagues said negation didn&amp;rsquo;t do that.  That is, consider &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;epsilon; &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; = &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;perp;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, consider the property of being an &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; such that the property that anything has when &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; instantiates itself as a property is the same thing as the property that nothing has.  (In other words, consider the property of not being self instantiating, but we won&amp;rsquo;t say that, since we have nice arguments about the logic of negation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;] alone, we can deduce &amp;perp;.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the proof&lt;/a&gt;.  It has fifteen steps, each one of which is one of those five rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is a serious problem for anyone who likes na&amp;iuml;ve theories of properties.  You&amp;rsquo;ve got to say which of those rules break down: and by &amp;lsquo;break down&amp;rsquo; I mean something very precise.  For which of the rules [&amp;perp;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;], [&amp;epsilon;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;], [=&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;] and [=&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;]  are you prepared to accept the premise and reject the conclusion?  If you can&amp;rsquo;t do that, then a forced march down &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bang.pdf&#34;&gt;the proof&lt;/a&gt; suffices to commit you to &amp;perp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what will it be?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/05/07/Bob_Meyer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I received the sad news that Bob Meyer, my former colleague at the ANU, and friend, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/strenge&#34;&gt;two-time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/desecsed&#34;&gt;collaborator&lt;/a&gt;, died last night, after a long struggle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob will be sorely missed by many of us. His warmth and humour, his brilliance, and his willingness to talk logic (and much more) to anyone and everyone, will all be impossible to replace.  If I manage to show a small fraction of both his logical insight, and his ability to communicate difficult concepts with good humour and wit, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a happy philosophical logician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I&amp;rsquo;m off to Adelaide for one of our many Adelaide&amp;ndash;Melbourne logic weekend funfests. This time it will be a bittersweet occasion, with many opportunities share our stories of the Maximum Leader of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~rkm/manifesto.html&#34;&gt;Logicians&amp;rsquo; Liberation League&lt;/a&gt;, and to toast his passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, David Chalmers &lt;a href=&#34;http://fragments.consc.net/djc/2009/05/bob-m.html&#34;&gt;remembers Bob fondly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consc.net/cgi-bin/picsearch.pl?keyw=meyer&#34;&gt;links to some photos&lt;/a&gt;, and points to Bob&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/2215186&#34;&gt;notorious paper&lt;/a&gt; in which he proves that God&amp;rsquo;s existence is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Bob, for all you&amp;rsquo;ve done for me.  My work and my life has been enriched in having you as a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Allen Hazen pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=67&#34;&gt;this nice interview&lt;/a&gt; Julian Bagnini conducted with Ernie Lepore, on words. Lepore comes to the same sort of conclusion as Kaplan &amp;ndash; that identity conditions for words are tricky.  He&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Types, Tokens and Names</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/27/types_tokens_and_names/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s quiz&lt;/a&gt; was from the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;http://admin.cdh.ucla.edu/webpage.php?par=98&#34;&gt;David Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;, in the article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstor.org/stable/4106880&#34;&gt;Words&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society&lt;/em&gt;, Supplementary Volume, LXIV 1990).  As Robbie mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/&#34;&gt;in the comments&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; is &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a cool paper.  I want to give an example of how cool it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think of &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;, repeatable things that the are, as the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt; inscriptions, jottings, arrangements of pixels, utterances and all of the other kinds of ways we find to express words.  Kaplan argues in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; that this isn&amp;rsquo;t right.  I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the argument here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about one example he gives along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the special case of names.  My name &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; is, in one sense, the same name as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/philosophy/staff/gregory-currie.php&#34;&gt;Greg Currie&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s name &amp;ndash; we share the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo;.  In another sense, in the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Arts-Minds-Gregory-Currie/dp/0199256284/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Arts and Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but Greg wrote &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Introduction-Fundamentals-Greg-Restall/dp/0415400686/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the two uses of the string &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different names, and different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;.  They don&amp;rsquo;t have the same referent, and hence, they don&amp;rsquo;t have the same meaning.  Saying it like that (without the addition of surnames) is not necessarily the clearest way to say it, but if you get both of us together &amp;ndash; last done in a pub in Nottingham in October 2005 &amp;ndash; you could say exactly those words and make perfectly good, non-confusing sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you might think that the two uses of the generic name &amp;lsquo;Greg&amp;rsquo; are different &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; because they differ in referent, and that the only way two names of the same type could genuinely be &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; (and not one name after all) is that the case is like this &amp;ndash; that they have different referents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Kaplan, in &amp;ldquo;Words&amp;rdquo; gives a delightful counterexample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about the case of the mischievous Babylonian. One evening, the mischievous Babylonian looked up and saw Venus, and he thought to himself &amp;ldquo;This one is just as beautiful as Phosphorus, so let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; too&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Babylonian names Venus (under the guise of the evening star) &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;in honour&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;lsquo;Phosphorus&amp;rsquo;, the morning star, little knowing that he has re-named the one and the same planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just think: later, after learning some more celestial mechanics, the astronomer can say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goodness!  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before, but now I see: &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Phosphorus&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this can make perfect sense as something that was &lt;em&gt;discovered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that individuating names is not as easy as we might hope. Genealogy, in all is contingent glory, plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave it as an exercise to the reader to apply this to the Paderewski case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quiz for today</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here is today&amp;rsquo;s quiz question.  Which master of exposition said &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, and where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arguing for years, unconvincingly, that semantic value (properly understood) is not affected by substitution, I hit upon a brilliant, new, and completely successful, strategy: argue, instead, that semantic value &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; affected by substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt;: the quote occurs after in the context of a discussion of proper names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Upon reflection, that&amp;rsquo;s not much of a hint, is it?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post your guess as to who I&amp;rsquo;m quoting, in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/03/25/quiz_for_today&#34;&gt;comments form on this post&lt;/a&gt;.  (You can post an informed answer too, if you like, but I suspect a guess would be even more fun.)  The most interesting answer will receive a &lt;em&gt;prize&lt;/em&gt; in the honest-to-goodness snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spandrels of Truth</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/03/25/spandrels_of_truth/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Whoever thought that teaching in three subjects, chairing one committee, participating in another one with a honking big project to keep on the rails for the next few months, supervising &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; research students (for a seriously large value of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;) and trying to keep your research ticking over would keep you busy with work?  I did think that.  But now I know it by acquaintance, and not merely by dispassionate theoretical reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not here to moan.  I&amp;rsquo;m here to make you an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend, colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/pluralism&#34;&gt;co-author&lt;/a&gt; (more like partner in crime) &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/Site/Home.html&#34;&gt;Jc Beall&lt;/a&gt; has gone and written &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Spandrels-Truth-Jc-Beall/dp/0199268738/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Spandrels of Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  (He&amp;rsquo;s one of these ridiculously prolific authors.)  Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s a cracker of a read, on the view that if we take seriously the idea that to say that &amp;lt;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; is true is no more and no less than to say that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then the inconsistencies like the liar paradox are side-effects of the &amp;lsquo;design&amp;rsquo; decisions, just like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel&#34;&gt;spandrels&lt;/a&gt; in architecture, and are neither to be worried about nor gotten rid of: instead, they&amp;rsquo;re to be lived with.  Jc&amp;rsquo;s job is to convince us all of this by supplying us a paraconsistent logic and enough semantic machinery to show that living with them is not going to make the whole building fall down.  I think he does a great job, and that this book is required reading for anyone thinking about theories of truth, paradoxes and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the required reading is not too expensive.  Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/temp/Spandrels.pdf&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; for your ordering, and Oxford University Press will shave 20% off the price.  Go buy it.  Help Jc rocket up the best-seller lists.  But be quick. The 20% discount lasts only until June 11, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back in Melbourne.  Z and I have been back for over a week &amp;ndash; and I&amp;rsquo;ve been back at work since the middle of last week, slowly setting up while Z has been settling into school.  C returns tomorrow, and the place will feel like home at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophy blogosphere is all a-flutter with the release of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/&#34;&gt;2009 Leiter Report&lt;/a&gt;.  We have known for some time that the troubles here at Melbourne &lt;a href=&#34;http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/biggest-drops-in-overall-ranking-in-the-new-pgr.html&#34;&gt;would impact our rating&lt;/a&gt;  and the result is there for all to see.  We&amp;rsquo;re out of the top ranking in Australia, sinking below Monash in the report&amp;rsquo;s league tables.  Still, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to recognise that in the discipline rankings we&amp;rsquo;re notable in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown12.asp&#34;&gt;Applied Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Feminist Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown30.asp&#34;&gt;Mathematical Logic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown19.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophy of Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/breakdown/breakdown5.asp&#34;&gt;Philosophical Logic&lt;/a&gt;.  For a very small core of a department, we do rather well.  We have a very nice group from which to rebuild a decent department &amp;ndash; the trick will be managing the rebuilding phase.  Please wish us luck (or if you can, lend us your support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip was wonderful.  I needed the break, and I enjoyed visting Pitt, CMU and UConn (thanks Shawn, Anil, Bob, Nuel, Kevin, Steve, Kohei, Horacio, Jc, Katrina, Marcus, Aaron, Colin, Reed, Michael, Scott, and everyone else, for your hospitality), and we had much fun at each stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, I&amp;rsquo;m back in the saddle, confronted with a heavy class load &amp;ndash; comprising &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/800-123&#34;&gt;first-year logic&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-241&#34;&gt;upper-level logic subject&lt;/a&gt; I affectionately call &amp;ldquo;Kurt G&amp;ouml;del&amp;rsquo;s Greatest Hits&amp;rdquo;, and four classes in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-434&#34;&gt;fourth-year seminar on Epistemology and Metaphysics&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about recent work on truthmaking, from Lowe and Rami&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1844651452/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;handy new collection&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; as well as some new postgraduate students (hi, Simon, hi Aaron!), significant administrative repsonsibilities, and writing and editing tasks I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep on the boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, work is busy.  If you&amp;rsquo;re waiting on an email from me, hold on. I&amp;rsquo;m getting to it.  I&amp;rsquo;m knocking the pile down each day, and at the moment, the pile is getting smaller, rather than bigger, so you can expect that I&amp;rsquo;ll get to yours at some time in the finite future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re having a wonderful time on our holiday, cruising through the southwest of the USA.  The sights have been spectacular, varied and unexpected.   The highlight so far was Bryce Canyon.  The Grand Canyon is grand, and sublime in its own way.  Bryce Canyon was totally unexpected: I had no idea erosion could do just &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010494&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Z ran around like a madman enjoying the snow, and the awesome view.  But the highlight for Z has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042/P1010250&amp;amp;bgcolor=black&#34;&gt;throwing snowballs&lt;/a&gt;, something doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature in the average Melbourne kid&amp;rsquo;s average day.  Bigger photos, for those who want to keep up, are accumulating in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gallery.me.com/greg_restall#100042&#34;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Zion National Park, we&amp;rsquo;re off to Las Vegas.  There, we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to meeting &lt;a href=&#34;http://obscureandconfused.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Greg Frost-Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in our couple of days there.  (As well as the sensory overload of the Strip, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going on a &lt;em&gt;holiday&lt;/em&gt;! Tomorrow at noon, we&amp;rsquo;ll be on a Qantas 747 to LA, and at the other end, the three of us will be enjoying four weeks of break.  It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; time off for all of us, with a few detours for work talks for me (at Pitt, and at UConn) and for Christine (at Harvard, San Diego, Berkeley and maybe Stanford).  It&amp;rsquo;s our &amp;lsquo;consolation tour&amp;rsquo; in place of what was our original plan: a year in the USA, based in Pittsburgh.  That fell through&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s a complicated story, all to do with Melbourne, nothing to do with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitt.edu/~philosop&#34;&gt;Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, where people have been generous, understanding and gracious.  Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not visiting Pitt for a year, but we&amp;rsquo;re touring the US, having a break, seeing the sights (like the Grand Canyon, Death Valley, and Las Vegas) and visiting friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Pittsburgh, I&amp;rsquo;ll finally get to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://indexical.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Shawn&lt;/a&gt; whose blog I&amp;rsquo;ve read for ages, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~philosop/people/gupta.html&#34;&gt;Anil&lt;/a&gt;, whose work I&amp;rsquo;ve read and learned from for much longer.   At UConn, I&amp;rsquo;ll catch up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.me.com/jcbeall/&#34;&gt;Jc&lt;/a&gt;, which is always a blast, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.uconn.edu/~mar08022/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s moved there.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also got the honour of giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu/lecture.php&#34;&gt;inaugural annual lecture&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.uconn.edu&#34;&gt;UConn Logic Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be posting here unless I get web access, and I think that this isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority on the holiday.  But after I&amp;rsquo;m back in February, I expect to be posting here more often.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Little Snippets of News</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Here are some random, miscellaneous items of news, concerning what&amp;rsquo;s been happening around here, around now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting, but lots of fun, to host visitors.  Since just before Christmas, we&amp;rsquo;ve had visits from two good friends (separately) and four family members (one batch of three and one solo), as well as meals with other friends over the Christmas/Summer period.  Much fun was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to share good experiences in Melbourne with family and friends.  Highlights have included Day 2 of the Boxing Day test, &lt;a href=&#34;http://shanewarnethemusical.com.au/&#34;&gt;Shane Warne: the musical&lt;/a&gt;, and an evening watching (or re-watching) the &lt;em&gt;Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt; and singing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally redesigned the site in a way I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see and to use.  &lt;em&gt;Again&lt;/em&gt;.  There are two causes, one proximate, and one more long-term.  The proximate cause was the superabundance of spam to moderate, on my own &lt;a href=&#34;http://segpub.com.au&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.  Logging in and cleaning out spam, arriving at the rate of at least one a minute, was depressing.  So no more hosted weblog software for me.  Instead, this site is now hand crafted on my computer (using &lt;a href=&#34;http://webby.rubyforge.org&#34;&gt;Webby&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s been fun to learn &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby-lang.org&#34;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;) and uploaded to the server as a static site.  When I want comments on an item, I can implement them using &lt;a href=&#34;http://intensedebate.com&#34;&gt;intense debate&lt;/a&gt; or some other commenting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more long-term aim of the redesign was to make the information here more accessible.  In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make it easier to browse my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/writing/topics&#34;&gt;papers, categorised by topic&lt;/a&gt; and these &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/&#34;&gt;news items&lt;/a&gt;.  Each news item &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2009/01/07/little_snippets_of_news/&#34;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; carry with themselves links to other news items from the same year.  It was dead-simple to code up the scripts to do this, and I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it makes browsing around the past of this weblog a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments haven&amp;rsquo;t been transferred from the old site, yet, but they&amp;rsquo;re on my list of things to do.   I hope you like the new site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year at work, as I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/03/30/were_in_the_news/&#34;&gt;hinted at&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.  There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more going on than that going on. My leave over this summer break has been more than welcome.  I&amp;rsquo;m away from the office for an extended period (for two weeks already, and I return only on February 23).  For some of this leave, starting tomorrow, we&amp;rsquo;re going on a trip to the US, to get away from it all.  The fact that we get to be there during Obama&amp;rsquo;s inauguration is a bonus!  More on the trip, in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Merry Christmas, all</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/24/merry_christmas_all/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas break here, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break, with visits from family and friends, and then a trip to the USA for a holiday (and for a couple of little side trips to see friends and give a few talks).  More about that in a little while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share the Christmas spirit, I&amp;rsquo;ll share a favourite carol:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tree of life my soul hath seen,&lt;br /&gt;
Laden with fruit and always green:&lt;br /&gt;
The trees of nature fruitless be&lt;br /&gt;
Compared with Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His beauty doth all things excel:&lt;br /&gt;
By faith I know, but ne&amp;rsquo;er can tell&lt;br /&gt;
The glory which I now can see&lt;br /&gt;
In Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For happiness I long have sought,&lt;br /&gt;
And pleasure dearly I have bought:&lt;br /&gt;
I missed of all; but now I see&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;rsquo;Tis found in Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m weary with my former toil,&lt;br /&gt;
Here I will sit and rest awhile:&lt;br /&gt;
Under the shadow I will be,&lt;br /&gt;
Of Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fruit doth make my soul to thrive,&lt;br /&gt;
It keeps my dying faith alive;&lt;br /&gt;
Which makes my soul in haste to be&lt;br /&gt;
With Jesus Christ the apple tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan is to reboot the blog (and to fix the comment system, which is down for the count just now) for 2009.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see how we go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Always More...</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/09/always_more/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;(What follows is a bundle of ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write up for some time.  Instead of making it a fully fledged paper, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to rough it out first as a blog post.  If anything comes of it, I&amp;rsquo;ll polish it up.  Let me know what you think.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any possible worlds?  The idea of a &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; in logical space &amp;ndash; at which every proposition is either True or False &amp;ndash; seems at the one and the same time compelling and repellant.  The notion plays a vital role in the semantics of logics of modality and conditionality, and so, is compelling.  It is hard to take modal logic seriously without points in models that play the role of deciding every statement one way other the other.  But to take possible worlds seriously as more than a useful fiction has seemed too great a price for many to pay.  This squeamishness seems, to many, to have a distinctly &amp;lsquo;ontological&amp;rsquo; flavour.  Places at which there are blue swans or in which kangaroos have no tails seems to crowd the halls of being with blue swans and tailless kangaroos.  We would do better without such things if we can.   If we can explain possible worlds away &amp;ndash; as propositions, or stories or abstracta or something else relatively tame &amp;ndash; then we should.  But ontological squeamishness is not my complaint about non-actual possible worlds.  Instead of their non-actuality, my worry about possible worlds is their &lt;em&gt;worldishness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, I worry about the way that these infinitely precise &lt;em&gt;points&lt;/em&gt; are then put to use in semantics.  Given that worlds are Deciders of Every Proposition, does it make sense to then turn around and think of a proposition as an arbitrary set of worlds: to think of any set of worlds as the kind of thing that can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; a proposition? (David Lewis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=mdVur1qVLr8C&#34;&gt;On the Plurality of Worlds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Chapter 1) is a very good defence of this position, but it is not just his. The view is everywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll use this post to explain why this might not be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grant you: worldlike entities are rife in the study of logics.  Tarski&amp;rsquo;s models for the first-order predicate logic decide every statement in the language as either true or false.  A model is worldlike because it provides consistent and complete scenario, down to the finest detail the language can muster.  It seems inherent in the very notion of classical logic, with its two valued semantics.  Since every statement is either true or false, a world is exactly the kind of think we seem to be talking about when we use some arrangement of truth values consistent with the rules of the logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But maybe this is not how we need to think about things: consider the case of classical propositional logic, and think back to how you were taught truth tables.  To show that &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; is a tautology, you showed that it received the value &lt;em&gt;True&lt;/em&gt; in every row of a truth table.  Now, how many rows did you use? Hopefully, &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt;, one for each different possible assignment of &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; to the sentence letters &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  Any fewer than four rows would have left out some possibilities you should have checked, and any more than four rows would have been more than you needed to look at.  The truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; depends only on the truth or falsity of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, and not on the Values of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; or any other sentence letter.  You check the value of your sentence not at a &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;, but at a row of a truth table which is a much blunter instrument: it cares not about most of the sentences in the language.  It knows just enough to decide the truth of the sentences in its remit, in this case, sentences formed out of &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &amp;lsquo;((&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;rarr; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, so for every sentence.  Assuming that the stock of sentence letters is boundless (say, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;) &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; sentence will exhaust the vocabulary.  Each sentence can be decided by a row of a truth table, and no (finite) truth table will decide every sentence.  Each sentence in the vocabulary of propositional logic is finite, and so, no matter how long it goes on, there is always more vocabulary left to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can formalise this. For any sentence &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, let #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be the first sentence letter not included in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  So, #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; are related in interesting ways.  In particular, if you can show that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any row of a truth table where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true is one where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true too, then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.  Why?  Since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is a sentence letter not occurring in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, the absence of a row in which &lt;em&gt;#A&lt;/em&gt; is true and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; false means that there&amp;rsquo;s no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  It&amp;rsquo;s a tautology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we have three more facts like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; then &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where, in general, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x22A6; &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; holds when there is no row of a truth table where each member of &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is true and each member of &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is false.   In general, if there is no row of the table where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false) and where #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has some value (say false, also) then there is no row where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false, since the value of #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is completely independent from the value of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;?  It encodes the idea of indefinite extensibility: no matter what our sentence says, there is always something more to say.  (Call these four conditions the &lt;em&gt;rules of extensibility&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;, then if there are possible worlds, not every set of possible worlds counts as a proposition.   Here is why.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of possible worlds, and take a particular world &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;.  If {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is a proposition, what about #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}?  Since {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t contradictory (it&amp;rsquo;s true &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, namely, at &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;), we don&amp;rsquo;t have {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6; #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;}, and similarly, we don&amp;rsquo;t have #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;},{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} &amp;#x22A6;.  In other words, we need somewhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} isn&amp;rsquo;t, and we need somwhere that {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} and #{&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} are both true.  That&amp;rsquo;s impossible.  There&amp;rsquo;s only one place {&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;} is true, namely &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if singletons of worlds are propositions, then there is no operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;. (There is a dual argument concerning complement propositions, which are true at every world except for one.  They cause just as much havoc to &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have indefinite extensibility for propositions, then no statement can single out a world, for that would be a &amp;ldquo;final proposition&amp;rdquo; for which no extensibility is possible.  If for every proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we can find some proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; independent of it, possible worlds are always idealisations, out of reach of a proposition.  We can always &lt;em&gt;approximate&lt;/em&gt; worlds relative to a given vocabulary, but if vocabularies an be extended, what we take to be a world is really a collection of worlds, to be further subdivided as new vocabulary is added.  If &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is an operator, not all set of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; (those infinitely precise &amp;ldquo;Deciders of Every Proposition&amp;rdquo;) count as a proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that would be all well and good, if there were an operator like &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo;.  Is there any operator like it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not: the first problem is that &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as it stands is not really an operator or a connective like &amp;lsquo;&amp;not;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;and;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;or;&amp;rsquo;, since #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; depends on how &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is presented.  For example, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and #(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;and; (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;or; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) should be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could smooth this wrinkle by defining &amp;lsquo;#&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; to be not the first sentence letter not occuring in &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but rather, the first sentence letter not occuring in any sentence &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  In that case, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, so that is better.  But now the question must remain: if &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is a genuine operator we can nest it: what is ##&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;? It is the first sentence letter not occurring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.   Consider ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  The first sentence letter not occuring in anything equivalent to #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is, of course, p&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, since #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to itself, and &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur in #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  But on the other hand, #&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so ##&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; should really be &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; itself!  Perhaps &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; works as a way to transform sentences into other sentences, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thought of as an operator like the logical connectives.  Maybe it cannot be coherently defined in such a way to satisfy the four rules of extensibility.  Maybe there is no threat to propositions as arbitrary sets of infinitely precise worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might seem like that, but to conclude that there is no &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; would be wrong.  Although the definition of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; in terms of sentence letters is dubious, and does not give rise to a coherent operator when we attempt to nest it, it turns out that we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; model a connective satisfying the rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think in terms of worlds, to start.  Take the set &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;worlds&lt;/em&gt; as the irrational numbers in the Real Line.  The propositions at &lt;em&gt;Level n&lt;/em&gt;  are the unions of the any selection of irrational intervals of length &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is an integer.  These are closed under union (the union of any collections of intervals is a collection of intervals), intersection (there is no worry about endpoints of abutting intervals, as these don&amp;rsquo;t reach their endpoints, which are rational) and complement (the complement of some collection of intervals is the collection of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; intervals: since the endpoints are rational, they don&amp;rsquo;t occur in either a set or its complement).  The propositions at each level are &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; classifications of points than at any of the previous level.  Propositions at Level 0 are collections of intervals such as (-2,-1), (0,1), (3,4), etc.  Propositions at Level 1 are collections of &lt;em&gt;finer&lt;/em&gt; intervals (-1.5,-1), (1.5,2), (3,3.5), etc., and so on&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s interpret sentences in the language of propositional logic &amp;ndash; enhanced with the operator &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; as propositions at &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level or other.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, then &amp;not;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;and;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&amp;or;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; are also interpreted as propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, since the union, intersection or complement of propositions at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; are also at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To interpret #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is interpreted as a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, we will choose a proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1.  In particular, we will choose an &lt;em&gt;alternating&lt;/em&gt; proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1: the proposition consisting of all of the intervals (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) where &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; is even integer.  The alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-4,-3) &amp;cup; (-2,-1) &amp;cup; (0,1) &amp;cup; (2,3) &amp;cup; (4,5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the alternating proposition at Level &lt;em&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; (-2,-1.5) &amp;cup; (-1,-0.5) &amp;cup; (0,0.5) &amp;cup; (1,1.5) &amp;cup; (2,2.5) &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on.  It turns out that this choice for #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; satisfies the four rules of extensibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; be interpreted as a proposition at level &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true everywhere, then it is false at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Now consider #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  It is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not true.  Similarly, if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is not false everywhere, it is true at some interval (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,(&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; at  (2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  And #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not true&lt;/em&gt; at ((2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;,(2&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;+2)/2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true.  In other words, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is truly independent of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.  If &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false somewhere, at some such places, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is true, and at others, #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is completely general.  We for any proposition &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; we have found another proposition #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  #&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is more finely grained than &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, and the four rules of extensibility are satisfied.  In models like these, it makes sense to think of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; as an operator on propositions, and not merely a syntactic device for constructing sentences from other sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeal to worlds in these models is not essential:  we refrain from all talk of worlds and appeal instead to &lt;em&gt;regions&lt;/em&gt; in a formal topological space.  The definition of propositions in terms of sets of points &amp;ndash; irrational numbers in our case &amp;ndash; is not essential.  The construction gives us an atomless boolean algebra, and these are well known algebraic structures.  The value of the relatively concrete construction here is the manner in which extensibility corresponds to propositions being more and more finely grained, without that ever coming to an end.  The model shows that the idea of indefinite extensibility of propositions is coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell if there are there any possible worlds, and if there are, if arbitrary sets of them count as propositions.   What I can say, however, is that if there is indefinite extensibility, such as expressed by &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; and the logic of &amp;lsquo;#&amp;rsquo; is coherent &amp;ndash; then not all sets of worlds are propositions.  For any proposition, there is always more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to Lloyd Humberstone, who got me first thinking about #, at a Melbourne Logic Seminar in 2006.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are, of course, most welcome.  Is this crazy?  Sensible?  Anodyne?  Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Assertion, Denial and Non-Classical Theories</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/04/new_paper_assertion_denial_and_nonclassical_theories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on a roll with the writing: I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get another paper converted from slides-from-a-talk to real, live, words on a page and actual &lt;em&gt;proofs&lt;/em&gt;.  The paper I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over the last couple of days is from my presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; on non-classical theories like non-classical theories of numbers, classes, or truth.  I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with this one, as it&amp;rsquo;s an application of my recent work &amp;ndash; on proof theory &amp;ndash; to a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;for some time&lt;/a&gt;, non-classical theories like na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes or of truth.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I urge friends of truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts &amp;ndash; proponents of paracomplete and paraconsistent logics &amp;ndash; to consider theories not merely as sets of sentences, but as &lt;em&gt;pairs&lt;/em&gt; of sets of sentences, or what I call &amp;lsquo;bitheories,&amp;rsquo; which keep track not only of what &lt;em&gt;holds&lt;/em&gt; according to the theory, but also what &lt;em&gt;fails&lt;/em&gt; to hold according to the theory.  I explain the connection between bitheories, sequents, and the speech acts of assertion and denial. I illustrate the usefulness of bitheories by showing how they make available a technique for characterising different theories while abstracting away from logical vocabulary such as connectives or quantifiers, thereby making theoretical commitments independent of the choice of this or that particular non-classical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples discussed include theories of numbers, classes and truth.  In the latter two cases, the bitheoretical perspective brings to light some heretofore unconsidered puzzles for friends of na&amp;iuml;ve theories of classes and truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is a turnabout for me. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a slow turn for some time, from being a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/nstlp/&#34;&gt;friend of na&amp;iuml;ve set theory in paraconsistent logics&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/dlpsr/&#34;&gt;friend of truth-value gaps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/onlogics&#34;&gt;over gluts&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/costing/&#34;&gt;friendly critic of non-classical approaches to things like Curry&amp;rsquo;s paradox&lt;/a&gt;.  In this paper, I present what I take to be much more problematic paradoxes around Frege&amp;rsquo;s Law (V), for which connectives like negation and the conditional do not feature at all, so questions of the design of the non-classical logic of negation or of the conditional are beside the point when it comes to the paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d very much appreciate feedback on this paper.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this sort of thing, &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/adnct.pdf&#34;&gt;read the paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/adnct/&#34;&gt;post your comments on the paper&amp;rsquo;s page, over here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Paper: Truth Values and Proof Theory</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/12/02/new_paper_truth_values_and_proof_theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to get back into writing.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;Truth Values and Proof Theory&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for a long time.  I presented a research seminar on this material last year &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s taken me this long to write it up, due to other commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper I present an account of truth values for classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and the modal logic S5, in which truth values are not a fundamental category from which the logic is defined, but rather, feature as an idealisation of more fundamental logical features arising out of the proof theory for each system.  The result is not a new set of semantic structures, but a new understanding of how the existing semantic structures may be understood in terms of a more fundamental notion of logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like these results, as they&amp;rsquo;re a mix of motivating philosophy, and formal proofs.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m getting a better understanding of the relationship between the [&lt;em&gt;Cut&lt;/em&gt;] rule in a sequent calculus and the &lt;em&gt;maximality&lt;/em&gt; conditions involved in the behaviour of things like two-valued evaluations, possible worlds and points in model structures for other sorts of logics.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence that sequents have two sides, and that there are two truth values.   I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve plumbed the depth of the connections between proof theory and model theory, but at the very least in writing this paper up I&amp;rsquo;ve got a better idea of some of the interesting questions around this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those &amp;lsquo;bonus&amp;rsquo; results that I&amp;rsquo;ve got out of this research a uniform way of proving completeness for classical logic, Kripke and Beth models for intuitionistic logic, and universal models for S5, all with exactly the same sort of structure.  That was a surprise to me when I saw those results just fall out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments on the paper, of course, are welcome.  Don&amp;rsquo;t comment on it here, but on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/tvpt/&#34;&gt;paper page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got to figure out how to massage these results into &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/ptp/&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;.  (It&amp;rsquo;s a pity my backlog of other writing-up tasks is so long, but that seems to be the natural state of the academic these days.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;My trip to Guangzhou was super.  Thanks, Guoxin, Min and Xuefeng for looking after me and showing me the sights of Guangzhou, and to Professors Ju and Zhu for the invitation.  It was a wonderful experience for me, and I look forward to many more visits to China, and to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been off to Canberra for a little workshop on hyperintensionality, organised by David Chalmers.  Much fun was had there, too, but I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m even more confused than I was when I started.  It must have been all that talking to Max Cresswell, Lloyd Humberstone and John Bigelow about how semantics works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of this site seems to be travel announcements, so rather than break the trend, I&amp;rsquo;ll post another travel announcement. On Sunday, I&amp;rsquo;m off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/logic/english/Index.asp&#34;&gt;Institute of Logic and Cognition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.html&#34;&gt;Sun Yat-Sen University&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;http://logic.sysu.edu.cn/Article/xueshuxinxi/jididongtai/200811/681.html&#34;&gt;give three lectures on my research&lt;/a&gt;.  This is my first trip to China, so I&amp;rsquo;m more excited (and more nervous) than usual for an overseas trip.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Days #3 and #4</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/09/01/tartu_pluralism_days_3_and_4/</link>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phew&lt;/em&gt;! What a long rest-of-the conference!  I&amp;rsquo;m now back in Tallinn, after the rest of the conference: 5 talks on Day 3, and one wrapup talk on Day 4.  My comments concerning Days 3 and 4 will not be as extensive as those for Days 1 and 2.  I liked these as much as the earlier talks &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just that my stamina has flagged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-3:6a1d5811fed0537efcada76d38072369&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day kicked off with &lt;em&gt;Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&lt;/em&gt; presenting &amp;lsquo;Is Logic about Consequence?&amp;rsquo;  I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed finally getting the opportunity to hear Per speak, as his view of logical consequence &amp;ndash; a particular constructive type theory in which proof objects play a central role &amp;ndash; has always fascinated me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not looked into it in any depth.  Per argued that logic is not primarily about consequence, but must be also about the act of inference, and that distinguishing content and force in the judgement helps us understand the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is clearly right, and in my work since the &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/em&gt; book I&amp;rsquo;ve started to attend to these issues.  In &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/multipleconclusions/&#34;&gt;Multiple Conclusions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; I attended to the connection between valid sequents and the acts of assertion and denial.    While the account I give there is not one that Per would endorse, the constellation of issues connecting content and force, and the correctness of the steps we make in inferring conclusions from premises, are certainly in the domain of logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we had &lt;em&gt;Dag Westerst&amp;aring;hl&lt;/em&gt; with &amp;lsquo;Sources of Plurality.&amp;rsquo;  In this talk, Dag started off with our analysis of logical consequence as truth preservation in cases &amp;ndash; and distinguished this from interpretational accounts, in which it is &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; that counts, not hypothetical truth-in-some-case.  Consequence differs from &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; consequence by the choice of logical vocabulary to keep fixed, and to vary the other vocabulary arbitrarily.  Varying the choice of vocabulary gives you a range of different consequence relations. Dag had interesting results showing how to construct the vocabulary from the consequence relation rather than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we had &lt;em&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n Rayo&lt;/em&gt; working &amp;lsquo;Towards a Trivialist Account of Logic.&amp;rsquo; This wasn&amp;rsquo;t really about &lt;em&gt;pluralism&lt;/em&gt; as such, but rather, was about one sort of account of logical truths as statements which are, in a certain sense, &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt;, those statements whose denial is &lt;em&gt;unintelligible&lt;/em&gt;.  Agust&amp;iacute;n connected the notion of intelligibility with identity (he argued that if you take &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; to be identical to &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, then the &lt;em&gt;de re&lt;/em&gt; consideration of a case where &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is not &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; will strictly speaking be unintelligible) with modality (understood as truth in all intelligible scenarios) and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting trinity of considerations, and most interesting for me was the methodological points Agust&amp;iacute;n made about the kinds of &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt; we have in forming vocabulary.  The more identities we endorse, then the more scenarios become unintelligible, and the more &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; questions we cannot answer.  (According to Agust&amp;iacute;n there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; answer to the question of why water is H2O, or why Hesperus is Phosphorous.)  On the other hand, the more identities we endorse, the more consequences are derivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agust&amp;iacute;n was followed by &lt;em&gt;Marcus Rossberg&lt;/em&gt;  with &amp;lsquo;Pluralism about Logic Proper,&amp;rsquo; in which Marcus wanted to reconcile a Fregean view taking the topic-neutrality of logic seriously, with the pluralist sympathies of Carnap.  Marcus developed the idea of a &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;, for which different logics may be appropriate (say, constructive mathematics; quantum objects; etc.) and attempted to reconcile pluralism with a proper &amp;lsquo;lower limit&amp;rsquo; logic which is most general and applicable for all topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 3 was wrapped up by &lt;em&gt;Dag Prawitz&lt;/em&gt; who presented &amp;lsquo;Kinds of Pluralism in Logic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag&amp;rsquo;s talk started off with an excellent summary of the kind of logical pluralism favoured by JC and me, and then he proceeded to inquire about what logic ought to say about an inference: a transition to a conclusion &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; from premises &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Q&lt;/em&gt;, etc. He did not think that either of the claims made in the book &amp;ndash; (1) that if an argument is invalid then the inference from premises to conclusion makes a mistake or (2) that if an argument is valid, then it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to assert the premises and deny the conclusion &amp;ndash; sufficed to give an account of what is going on.  Dag&amp;rsquo;s preferred story is that valid arguments provide a way to transform the grounds of the premises into a ground for the conclusion, and that if an argument is &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the infer-er can use the argument to supply the ground for the conclusion of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to like about this view, I think.  It has an account of where the difference lies in knowing that an argument is valid, by showing that this gives you a means to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; from the premises to the conclusion, and there are very well developed theory of proofs (say, Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f&amp;rsquo;s proof objects or realisability semantics, or some other theory) which can give us accounts of the structures of such grounds and the way we can manipulate them (by taking them &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; in pairs; by &lt;em&gt;applying&lt;/em&gt; one to another in &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt;, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dag thought that this removed the need/desire for plurality, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure about this.  It seems to me that you could accept this, and think that there was a plurality, say, between deductive conseqence and formal consequence; and between classical formal consequence and intuitionist formal consequence; and perhaps also into relevant consequence &amp;mdash; if one had different accounts of what were allowable techniques for transforming one ground into another.  Mathematical reasoning, for example, uses &lt;em&gt;recursion&lt;/em&gt; as a technique for constructing a new ground out of old grounds, and this does not play a role in purely formal logical consequence. You might also say that classical reasoning uses a technique for constructing grounds (continuations, in the double-negation translation, or something more complicated with positive and negative &amp;lsquo;grounds&amp;rsquo; in a symmetric proof system) that are not permitted with intuitionist ground-formation.  The pluralist view of the move from premise to conclusion remains, but translated here into a very different key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s lots more to think about here, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to attempting to work some of it out, to see if the sketches I&amp;rsquo;m making here actually bear fruit.  If you do any thinking on these issues &amp;ndash; and get anywhere with them &amp;ndash; please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-4:6a1d5811fed0537efcada76d38072369&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on Sunday, we wrapped up with one talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;JC Beall&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;lsquo;Logical Pluralism, Validity and Truth-Preservation.&amp;rsquo; Here, JC brought together his interest in the paradoxes and the logical pluralism with the negative result to the effect that truth-in-a-case can&amp;rsquo;t be identified with truth (in the actual world) for Curry-paradoxical reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this &amp;ndash; primarily because I don&amp;rsquo;t really have settled ideas of what to think about truth.  It did convince me that it&amp;rsquo;s important to sort this out and be clear on the nature and properties of truth and its connections with logical consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was it!  It was a wonderful conference &amp;ndash; Daniel, Marcus and Peter did a wonderful job organising, and we all enjoyed ourselves immensely.  It was good to catch up with old friends and to make new ones.  I&amp;rsquo;ve left with lots more things to think about, and some new ways to do that thinking.  You can&amp;rsquo;t ask for anything more from a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this final report late in the evening in Tallinn.  Tomorrow I take the long journey back to Melbourne, via Amsterdam and Singapore.  Hopefully these conference reports have been useful if you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to come to the conference.  Writing them helped me collect my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #2</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/29/tartu_pluralism_day_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2008 17:46:48 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/29/tartu_pluralism_day_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;OK, it&amp;rsquo;s a short day here today &amp;ndash; thankfully, since I&amp;rsquo;m knackered after Day #1 &amp;ndash; with two talks.  Last night we dined at an Italian Restaurant, and I learned more about &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dutilh/articles/swyneshed.pdf&#34;&gt;Roger Swyneshed&lt;/a&gt; from Stephen Read, than I ever expected to learn.  Talks today are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter Pagin&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;em&gt;Universalist and Actualist Consequence&lt;/em&gt;.  Peter connected his work with &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~kgl/kathrin.htm&#34;&gt;Kathrin Gl&amp;uuml;er&lt;/a&gt; on relational modality and the semantics of names with considerations concerning the difference between universal validity (truth in all possible worlds whatsoever) and actualist validity (truth in all candidate actual worlds &amp;ndash; down the diagonal in a 2D semantics, for example). He indicated that his looks like our distinction, both should count as validity notions which ought to be endorsed.  Peter wondered whether this was a problem, and whether there&amp;rsquo;s a conflict between endorsing universalist validity and actualist validity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good question: I think that this is a good case where being a pluralist makes sense: if we think of validity as classifying deduction steps into those that are valid and those that aren&amp;rsquo;t, then actualist and universalist validity notions have their place.  Take the step from &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;.  This is OK in one obvious sense (we&amp;rsquo;d make a mistake to assert &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and deny &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;), and bad in another (that step doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if we are under a counterfactual assumption &amp;ndash; we grant that &lt;em&gt;not p&lt;/em&gt;, and then consider what would have happened were &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; the case &amp;ndash; we can&amp;rsquo;t infer from that to &lt;em&gt;actually p&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More must be done, of course, on what it is to &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; the logic, and to say why we might like to have both of these criteria in our toolkit.  I think we do want both, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think that arguing abou which of these is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;deductive validity&amp;rsquo; is fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next talk is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Johan van Benthem, for whom &lt;em&gt;Logical Pluralism Meets Logical Dynamics&lt;/em&gt;.  Johan kicked off by addressing the issue of what logic &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, noting that &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;computation&lt;/em&gt;, which are equally important.  Logical systems are neat&amp;ndash;they do all these things.  In the talk, rich with different ideas, the focus was on the &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; treatment of logic, of proof and deduction.  The thought is simple, but the consequences are rich: thinking of announcements as acts in which the space of possibilities is narrowed down, we can think of the argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt; when after announcing &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; (in that order), the announcement that &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; would be redundant.  The neat thing here is that Knower-paradoxical announcements (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; but you don&amp;rsquo;t know that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;) have interesting logical properties such that announcing them &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; has a different effect than announcing them once.  There are clearly different notions of information processing and deduction in play here, and as always, Johan&amp;rsquo;s work is rich with ideas and consequences for many people to work out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that the paper this talk was based on will be appearing in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;AJL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with commentaries by others, too.  So hopefully, that will bring the dynamic epistemic approach into conversation with other traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after lunch, we&amp;rsquo;re off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=estonia&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=58.525257,27.498779&amp;amp;spn=1.827038,3.339844&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=8&#34;&gt;the lake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tartu Pluralism Day #1</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2008 23:57:40 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu_pluralism_day_1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re coming semi-live from Tartu, as long as my computer&amp;rsquo;s battery lasts, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For live off-the-cuff comments, try my experimental &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/consequently&#34;&gt;twitter stream&lt;/a&gt;, which is profoundly silly, but fun to fiddle with on my phone when my fingers are itchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lineup today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, giving &amp;ldquo;Pluralism and Proofs.&amp;rdquo;  I think I went well.  Look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/2008/08/sneak-preview-greg-restall-on-logical.html&#34;&gt;Ole&amp;rsquo;s sneak-preview of what I said&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty-well what I said here.  The fact that Dag Prawitz and Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f didn&amp;rsquo;t eat me alive, but were actually interested, was profoundly reassuring.  I&amp;rsquo;ve only done the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/pluralism_and_proofs_[slides].pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, not a written version of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham Priest on &amp;ldquo;Logical Pluralism as another application of Chunk-and-Permeate.&amp;rdquo;  This is an interesting project, conceiving of logic&amp;rsquo;s application to a domain of reasoning as variegated &amp;ndash; a domain of discourse can be &amp;lsquo;chunked&amp;rsquo; into different bits, where different logics are operative, and then &amp;lsquo;permeation&amp;rsquo; relations tell us how facts in one chunk transfer over to facts in another.  Graham was using this general setup (which he introduced in earlier work with Bryson Brown, on the infinitesimal calculus &amp;ndash; one chunk is where the infinitesimal is zero, another chunk is where it&amp;rsquo;s nonzero, and you only permeate facts about non-infinitesimals, or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham&amp;rsquo;s take on pluralism here is that you can think of the different chunks as different kinds of things we&amp;rsquo;re reasoning about: quantum objects (with their quantum logic) and middle-sized dry goods and their non-quantum (say, classical logic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this application is really interesting, and it&amp;rsquo;s not what we (JC and I) talking about in our pluralism.  We&amp;rsquo;re pluralists about the logic used for evaluating &amp;ldquo;reasoning about&amp;rdquo; the same collections of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top question (or was it three?) came from Johan van Benthem, who pointed out the parallel with channel theory (I should have warned Graham about that because I should have spotted that!), and interesting applications in database combination, and legal reasons why information maybe shouldn&amp;rsquo;t flow from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After lunch, it&amp;rsquo;s Stephen Read and &amp;ldquo;General-Elimination Harmony and the Meaning of the Logical Constants,&amp;rdquo; which sounds like a good name for a bad cover band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all about &lt;em&gt;general elimination harmony&lt;/em&gt;: the notion that we can take the introduction rule for a connective as defining it, and a general elimination rule (defined in a systematic way,  at least for simple cases of introduction rules) can be reconstructed out of the introduction rule if that connective is to be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;connective&amp;rdquo; (in shudder quotes, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;connect&lt;/em&gt; anything) is the bullet (or blob) &amp;ndash; &amp;bull; &amp;ndash; with the introduction rule allowing us to infer &amp;bull; from a proof from &amp;bull; to absurdity.  He showed that one could define an appropriate general elimination rule in harmony with that introduction rule.  So it&amp;rsquo;s OK in some sense &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s harmonious &amp;mdash; but not a conservative extension of the underlying pre-&amp;bull; consequence relation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then went on to talk of the application of these notions to modality (which I&amp;rsquo;d heard from Stephen before in the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004787622057&#34;&gt;Harmony and Autonomy in Classical Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;), but then he went on to talk of conditionality.  Here, the discussion took an interesting turn, for Stephen pointed out that the necessary discussion of structural rules (which came up in the discussion of conjunction, disjunction, etc).  Ringing the changes on this &amp;ndash; or at least attending to questions about contraction and weakening &amp;ndash; give us a way to understand the logical behaviour of conditionality, for the structural rules feature prominently in the behaviour of the conditional rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; was fun, even more fun happened in discussion, with zingers of questions from Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f and Dag Prawitz.  Per pushed on the definition of the blob &amp;ndash; this definition literally makes no sense for Per, because for Per, you can&amp;rsquo;t prove that &amp;bull; is a proposition.  This is right, and it helped bring out the difference between Per&amp;rsquo;s constructive type theory and Stephen&amp;rsquo;s logic. Then Dag Prawitz pointed out that the choice of structural rules cannot be arbitrary, but must be constrained in some way: what is the ground for choosing one set of structural rules rather than another.  Stephen indicated that this is a really interesting question worth sorting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then next, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/&#34;&gt;Manuel Bremer&lt;/a&gt;, presenting &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mbph.de/Logic/Pluralism.pdf&#34;&gt;What is Logical Pluralism?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; He argued that our logical pluralism is not clear, and if it&amp;rsquo;s clear, it&amp;rsquo;s either not true, or not interesting.  This sounds ominous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;ominous&lt;/em&gt;.  It was a lovely example of how &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; perspectives on what logic is (or does) result in making pluralism look very implausible.  Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point was that logic has something to do with cognitive architecture&amp;ndash;in particular, that inferences arising out of generative grammar rules&amp;ndash;are genuinely valid, and that logic deviating from that just doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a grip on &lt;em&gt;what we&amp;rsquo;re thinking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I think, given the starting point, but I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with Manuel&amp;rsquo;s starting point.  This means, of course, that I should say something about the connection is between cognitive architecture and logical validity.  Yes, I should.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t said much, except to say that the connection between deductive consequence relations and the &lt;em&gt;inferences&lt;/em&gt; one does or should make are generally complicated matters, for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logicandlanguage.net/archives/2005/03/inference_vs_im_1.html&#34;&gt;the usual Harman-esque reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion, I must admit, got quite pointed at times, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect when people disagree about fundamental issues, and want to sort out where you disagree.  It was all in good fun, and Manuel sweetly came up to me afterwards to say &amp;ldquo;I hope you weren&amp;rsquo;t offended.&amp;rdquo;  Of course I wasn&amp;rsquo;t, and as Johan van Bentham mentioned in discussion time, Manuel lavished us with attention to bring out why so much of JC&amp;rsquo;s and my take on logical pluralism is wrong-headed from his view, and so much critical attention is &amp;ndash; indeed &amp;ndash; a form of praise.  Too right it is!  Thanks, Manuel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last up for today, Hartry Field, trying to find an &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; logical pluralism.   (The requirement for finding &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; views is a bit of a running joke here.)  I&amp;rsquo;ll write this up later when I recharge the battery on my computer.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a minute remaining on the battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m back.  Hartry&amp;rsquo;s talk featured lots of interesting concerns I can&amp;rsquo;t recount here (neither the time nor the space), but he major point for me was his connection between the notion of logical validity and constraint of degrees of belief.  Hartry argues (as he did in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/lectures/john_locke_lectures&#34;&gt;Locke lectures&lt;/a&gt;) that if one takes the inference from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; to be valid, then the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; should be no higher than the degree of belief of &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; (and this generalises for arguments with more premises), and that you &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; take validity to be necessary truth preservation, for this ensnares you in paradox.  Then since validity is a normative notion, and since Hartry thinks we should be anti-realists about norms, there is room for a kind of plurality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is not much room for plurality where it&amp;rsquo;s exciting, as far as Hartry can see, since that kind of wiggle room isn&amp;rsquo;t there when it comes to truth value gaps and truth value gluts.  The disagreement between a gap view and a glut view and classical view isn&amp;rsquo;t up for pluralism on this account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s completely right, by my lights. My disagreement with Graham Priest over whether or not a liar sentence is both true and false is not up for a pluralist reconciliation.  We just disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I think there&amp;rsquo;s scope for more work is the nature of the norms, and whether or not the connection between degree-of-belief management and deductive validity is two way, or only one way.  Is an argument from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; valid (or we know it&amp;rsquo;s valid, or whaever) &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; and only if we ought regulate our degree of belief to have &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) never over &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;)?  I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s right, but making the case for this &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt; requires close attention to what an attribution of degrees of belief involves, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/28/tartu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If this is Thursday, it must be Tartu.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; starts today, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m up first&lt;/a&gt;.  The nerves have started to jangle just a bit, since the audience is about as high-powered as any in my experience at international conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just as well as those who intimidate me the most this time around (due to their all-round awesomeness combined with the fact that this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve met them) &amp;ndash; Per Martin-L&amp;ouml;f,  Dag Prawitz and Johan van Benthem &amp;ndash; are uniformly warm and personable. (I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if that will make it better or worse when the knife gets sunk in to my position.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on time, attention and lots of other factors, I&amp;rsquo;ll try blogging a bit from the conference, though I won&amp;rsquo;t promise to keep up through the entire thing.  So, if you&amp;rsquo;re here and I don&amp;rsquo;t mention &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; presentation, please don&amp;rsquo;t hold that against me.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard enough to keep your attention up over an entire conference, let alone write something sensible, meaningful and worth-posting-on-the-internet about each and every talk at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk starts in roughly three hours from now.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amsterdam!</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/24/amsterdam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in Amsterdam.  Getting here was touch-and-go.  My decent wait between my Melbourne &amp;rarr; Singapore flight and my Singapore &amp;rarr; Amsterdam leg whittled down to around 45 minutes.  That involved a trek through the terminal, a tense wait at Transfer Desk C (where people in the queue in front of me were arguing with the staff about visas, and people behind me were concerned that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get on the flight &amp;ndash; and were expressing this concern, rather vocally).  I got there in the end, but it was a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Highlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;?  Reading 100 pages of Anil Gupta&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;Empricism and Experience&lt;/a&gt;.  This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good.  It&amp;rsquo;s (1) logically sharp, (2) applied to philosophical issues of deep concern and most interestingly (3) original and creative, and enlightening.   He cuts at deep issues with classical empiricism, at a level of abstraction that &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m convinced &amp;ndash; gets to the heart of the matter in a new and illuminating way.  Characterising classical empiricism as the result of a number of theses concerning what is given in experience (that it&amp;rsquo;s propositional, veridical, and multiply factorisable), and that this combination &amp;ndash; rather than the argument from Illusion and the debate surrounding this &amp;ndash; that dooms classical empiricism to never explain the epistemic success we have. It&amp;rsquo;s rigourous, illuminating and spot on.  (Oh, and the comments on Quine &amp;ndash; to the effect that accepts exactly the &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; parts of classical empiricism, to betray naturalism for a kind of idealism &amp;ndash; alone are worth the price of admission.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided now that when I grow up I want to be able to think and write like Anil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowlight of the trip&lt;/em&gt;? Having my order for an Asian Vegetarian meal ignored by KLM at one meal.  When I mentioned to the steward that this salad didn&amp;rsquo;t look very vegetarian (with the chicken and all), &amp;ndash; and that I had ordered a vegetarian meal when I booked my flight &amp;ndash; she apologised, and got me a replacement salad.  It looked like a very odd potato salad.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t place where I&amp;rsquo;d seen potato sliced so thinly in a potato salad, but there was so much mayonnaise that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell.  What I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell, of course, was that it was a salad whose principle ingredient (well, competing with the mayonnaise) was ham.  That&amp;rsquo;s a salad that vegetarians, Muslims and Jews can all get behind!  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the flight was fine.  I use flights to sleep, read, and while having meals, catch up on my trashy movie viewing. This time, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/&#34;&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/&#34;&gt;The Bank Job&lt;/a&gt;.  Both were enjoyable in a throwaway sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today I&amp;rsquo;ve waited at Schiphol for longer than I&amp;rsquo;d hoped to, waiting for my bag to catch up, strolled around the city, and pored over Dutch Masters at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl&#34;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got some more exploration to do this evening, and then tomorrow too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Bag packed, ticket &amp;amp; passport at the ready, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/macbookpro&#34;&gt;computer&lt;/a&gt; charged, &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.com/iphone&#34;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt; charged and synced, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Colossians-Remixed-Subverting-Brian-Walsh/dp/0830827382/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/dp/019536726X&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; located, papers to read/referee/assess all printed or downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must be going on a flight.  The trip takes me from Melbourne to Singapore to Amsterdam to Tallinn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Tartu&lt;/a&gt;, and then I retrace my steps to get back here in ten days.  That&amp;rsquo;s too much plane and airport time for my money, but I fully expect that &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; will be worth the discomfort.  Oh, the day-and-a-bit stopover in Amsterdam should &lt;a href=&#34;http://rijksmuseum.nl/&#34;&gt;be worth it too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pain, stress, redundancies, another day at the office</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2008 10:35:03 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/08/20/pain_stress_redundancies_another_day_at_the_office/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I had thought that we (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Faculty of Arts&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;) were trying to keep our difficulties an internal affair, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/arts-renewal/workforce-proposal.html&#34;&gt;apparently we&amp;rsquo;re not&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that this is all public news, I suppose I could comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-home-message from this memo from the Dean: (1) The budget in the Arts Faculty is not yet in the black, though it&amp;rsquo;s getting better, and (2) The plan is for more voluntary &amp;lsquo;redundancies&amp;rsquo; (this is now Round 3), this time with the shadow of involuntary redundancies is we don&amp;rsquo;t get enough voluntary ones to right the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discipline of Philosophy took an almighty hit at the end of Round 1. At the end of 2007 we had 5 departures out of a full-time teaching staff of 10.5.  So we&amp;rsquo;ve done rather more than our part of the deal in righting the budgetary situation &amp;ndash; except for the very real problem of &amp;lsquo;overcorrecting,&amp;rsquo; making it rather &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; difficult to teach a coherent Philosophy major in the BA (with keen, bright students ready to learn), supervise our wonderful graduate students, and get research done.   There are so few philosophers left, this round of redundancies is not directed at us, but we feel for our colleagues down the corridors, and across the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future for us is murky, but at least there&amp;rsquo;s very real prospect for rebuilding once the rest of the Faculty has sorted out its bottom line.  In the near term we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; creative to get enough bodies on the ground to do our jobs well.  We&amp;rsquo;re looking at other sources of funding, grants, bringing people on research fellowships, etc.  That&amp;rsquo;s all good, but of course, what we most need is a stable core group of people to teach and research and run the place.  In this environment, with the best will in the world from colleagues, it&amp;rsquo;s still touch and go as to how we get through it.  The next few months are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been rather out-of-communication on the website for the last months.  Both figuring out how to we philosophers at Melbourne work through this, and managing the stress it&amp;rsquo;s been causing has been a struggle.  (Ask my long-suffering spouse and child&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;ll tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Out of the five Australians who were chosen as nominating editors of this year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophersannual.org/&#34;&gt;Philosophers&amp;rsquo; Annual&lt;/a&gt;, four are from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;The University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  The lucky 4 are Hazen, Schroeter (Fran&amp;ccedil;ois), Schroeter (Laura), and Restall.  (The other Australian is David Chalmers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 out of 28 is a good strike rate (that&amp;rsquo;s 1 in 7, if you&amp;rsquo;re too lazy to do the mental arithmetic). This is a teensy bit higher than the representation of University of Melbourne Philosophers in the Whole Wide World.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet here, lately.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;busy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;, getting stuff done.  I hope to be posting more soon, when various up-in-the-air things are more settled.  Still, here are some recent highlights which are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/wcp4&#34;&gt;WCP4&lt;/a&gt; was a blast.  It was very busy, but lots of fun was had: it was good to catch up with many folks I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen for ages including (&lt;a href=&#34;http://logica.rug.ac.be/~dirk/&#34;&gt;Diderik Batens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://directory.uleth.ca/research/viewperson.html?uid=brown&#34;&gt;Bryson Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unica.it/~paoli/&#34;&gt;Francesco Paoli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://notofcon.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://olethhjortland.googlepages.com/home&#34;&gt;Hjortland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_jsel014&#34;&gt;Jerry Seligman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~grussell/&#34;&gt;Gill Russell&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC&lt;/a&gt;, who I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen in an all-too-long period of time) and to make the acquaintance of new folks (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www-ihpst.univ-paris1.fr/fberto&#34;&gt;Francesco Berto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.unc.edu/ripley.html&#34;&gt;David Ripley&lt;/a&gt;, Andreas Pietz, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogandnot-blog.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Burgis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/index.cfm?S=STAFF_pgir999&#34;&gt;Patrick Girard&lt;/a&gt; and many others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been lots of fun to have Andi Pietz, Dave Ripley and Ole Hjortland hang out with us in Melbourne this semester.  I think they&amp;rsquo;re having fun, and I&amp;rsquo;m having fun talking logic with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.portal.unimelb.edu.au/CSCApplication/view/2008/161-201&#34;&gt;Reasoning &amp;amp; Uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; is my new level &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; undergraduate subject.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got a class of 60, doing philosophy of probability, decision theory, etc., and we&amp;rsquo;re having a lot of fun.  Having students turn up to class, enthusiastic, despite 9am lectures, is something to behold.  Conrad Asmus is my tutor, and working with him makes things very easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/people/Conrad_Asmus/636311603&#34;&gt;Conrad Asmus&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; PhD student, has all-but-passed his PhD.  He has minor changes to make (which will be done within a few weeks, won&amp;rsquo;t they, Conrad?), and once they&amp;rsquo;re OKd by the local examiner, he&amp;rsquo;ll graduate. Congratulations, Conrad!  You&amp;rsquo;re my first beginning-to-end supervised graduate student, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have supervised your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Estonia in a week&amp;rsquo;s time, for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?program&#34;&gt;looks like&lt;/a&gt; it will be smaller, more focussed blast than WCP4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting back from Estonia, I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at a &amp;lsquo;Men&amp;rsquo;s Breakfast&amp;rsquo; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://stjohnswestbrunswick.org.au/&#34;&gt;my church&lt;/a&gt;, under the gradiose title of &amp;lsquo;From Church to the Campus and Back Again: tales from a Christian teaching Philosophy at University.&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m under instruction to be funny, serious, profound, accessible and provocative &amp;ndash; in under 20 minutes.  I&amp;rsquo;ll see how I go&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a hard year here, with reduced staffing numbers in Philosophy at Melbourne.  Everyone&amp;rsquo;s working Very Hard and doing Very Good Things, but until we get new positions and More People, things are going to be a struggle.  Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll have some better news soon, so we can advertise some jobs in the next few months.  Watch this space&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Logical Pluralism, in Tartu</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2008/04/16/logical_pluralism_in_tartu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to Tartu in late August, for what looks like a &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?conference&#34;&gt;really fun conference&lt;/a&gt; on logical pluralism.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?speakers&#34;&gt;list of speakers&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily high-powered.  Having so many smart people talk about logical pluralism is exciting, and not a little bit scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in coming along, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de/index.php?register&#34;&gt;let the organisers know by July 1&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the state of the art on logical pluralism, this conference is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&#34;http://daniel.cohnitz.de&#34;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~mr30/&#34;&gt;Marcus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm&#34;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; for organising this.  It&amp;rsquo;s going to be my highlight of the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://informallogic.ca&#34;&gt;Informal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on argumentation theory and related issues, is now open access and online, after a 27 year history as a print (closed access) journal.    The editors have sent out a request for interested parties to subscribe.  Subscription is free: just &lt;a href=&#34;http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/user/register&#34;&gt;fill in this form on the site&lt;/a&gt;. The editors are aiming get enough subscribers to secure funding from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sshrc.ca&#34;&gt;SSHRC&lt;/a&gt; to keep the journal going now that they&amp;rsquo;re not taking paid subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a worthy goal: the more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/ajl&#34;&gt;open access journals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://semprag.org&#34;&gt;the better&lt;/a&gt;!

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Alas, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/jobs-under-threat-at-melbourne-uni/2008/03/29/1206207499091.html&#34;&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; for not-very-good reasons.  Given the recent retirements in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;Philosophy at Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, it would be worse than surprising if any of the new redundancies hit Philosophy.  However, the atmosphere around here not good &amp;ndash; what concerns us most is the scope for new hiring when the Faculty as a whole is in the red so much.  It is very hard to effectively plan ahead when so much is in flux and you&amp;rsquo;re not sure whether your efforts will benefit the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to find out more when we hear what the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.unimelb.edu.au/about/faculty/&#34;&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unimelb.edu.au/about/seniorexec/davis.html&#34;&gt;Vice Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; has to say at a meeting of all Arts Faculty staff this Tuesday.  Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that they can articulate something that goes beyond slashing positions to rectify a budget hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to start posting on something so grim, but &amp;ldquo;trouble at t&amp;rsquo;mill&amp;rdquo; has been on our minds since mid-2007.  I hope to post more about more enjoyable things soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/writing/&#34;&gt;writing page&lt;/a&gt;. There are quite a few new items there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</link>

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/06/melbourne_philosophy_undergraduate_workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Are you an undergraduate student in philosophy, or do you know any undergraduate philosophy students?  If so, you might be interested in the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt; to be held from September 21 to 23.   This will be a chance for Australian and New Zealand undergraduate students who are interested in philosophy, to get together to talk philosophy with the faculty here at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.  Given that we have a broad range of interests, from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Ethics and Social Philosophy, Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic, this will be a fun weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for applying for a grant to come to the workshop is coming up very soon: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;August 15&lt;/strong&gt;.  For more details of how to be involved, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the weekend of September Friday 21 to Sunday 23,
Melbourne University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;School of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; will host the &lt;em&gt;Melbourne
Philosophy Undergraduate Workshop&lt;/em&gt;, aimed at
third and fourth year students who intend to continue in any branch of academic
philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friday evening&lt;/em&gt; will begin with a Welcome Meeting followed by
dinner on Lygon Street, Carlton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Saturday&lt;/em&gt;, Melbourne faculty members will give presentations and/or lead seminars on a range of topics &amp;ndash; from Continental and Asian Philosophy, through Philosophy of Science, to Metaphysics and Logic. Saturday evening, another dinner on Lygon Street with more discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Sunday&lt;/em&gt;, each student will give a 15-or-so minute philosophy presentation, followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion. This will continue after lunch until, satiated, we disperse to downtown Melbourne or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten particularly talented 3rd year and Honours students from across Australasia will be invited. Their transportation expenses will be covered up to $400, with a possibility of greater funds for students from Western Australia and New Zealand. Melbourne Philosophy will provide college accommodation for three nights, September 21 through 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interested students should submit a transcript, along with a letter discussing their philosophical interests and, if possible, an abstract of their presentation talk. A short letter of reference from a faculty member is also required. Deadline: &lt;strong&gt;15 August 2007&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your material to Dr. Neil Thomason at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:neilt@unimelb.edu.au&#34;&gt;neilt@unimelb.edu.au&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk on the Philosopher&#39;s Zone</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on Logic in Australia at &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/news-and-events/artsinaction07/program.php&#34;&gt;Monash University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Arts in Action&lt;/em&gt; festival&lt;/a&gt; in early June.  (This was a part of a long-running project on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://arts.monash.edu.au/phil/research/history/grant8.html&#34;&gt;History of Australasian Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  The talk is now appearing, in two parts, on the (wonderful) ABC Radio National program, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/&#34;&gt;The Philosopher&amp;rsquo;s Zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The first part was broadcast this weekend, but the audio can be downloaded from their &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2007/1992998.htm&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the next four weeks.  That was the first half of the talk, on possible worlds.  The second half, on paraconsistency, will be broadcast next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I made heavy use of digital projection.  I think you can follow the talk without it, but if you want to see the pretty pictures and diagrams, you can download the slides of the talk here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>... and we&#39;re back</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/05/_and_were_back/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2007 16:36:53 &#43;1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/08/05/_and_were_back/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in Melbourne for a while.  The trip was very enjoyable, but I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to Melbourne with a chest bug, which has meant that I&amp;rsquo;m not quite up to full speed yet.  All non-essential activities (and alas, some essential ones, I fear) are progressing much more slowly than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;Logica 2007&lt;/a&gt; with so many great people, and then exploring Prague, catching up with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/&#34;&gt;Richard&lt;/a&gt;, and getting to know more Czech logicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overdosing on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Medieval logic in Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and especially talking over Bradwardine with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring K&amp;oslash;benhavn with Christine and Zachary.  It was my second visit there, and Christine&amp;rsquo;s umpteenth, so it was a lot easier to get around given than we were more familiar with the place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating our way on the trains and buses from &amp;Aring;rhus to &lt;a href=&#34;http://legoland.dk&#34;&gt;Legoland in Billund&lt;/a&gt; with Zachary, and then enjoying all there was to see and do there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting everyone at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;Logic Colloquium in Wroc&amp;#322;aw&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; and especially thinking through &amp;ndash; with Pavel Pudl&amp;aacute;k, Albert Visser, Alasdair Urquhart and Vedran &amp;#x10C;a&amp;#x10D;i&amp;#x107; &amp;ndash; a counterexample to a conjecture of Grzegorczyk&amp;rsquo;s.  The result of our thinking is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.cas.cz/~pudlak/strings/doku.php?id=a_counterexample_to_a_conjecture_of_grzegorczyk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Most of the thinking got done in a hike in the hills near Wroc&amp;#322;aw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flying back home with Z. Normally he finds the in-flight entertainment much more attractive than mundane activities such as sleep.  This can sometimes cause difficulty, especially when flying in to an airport for a quick change of planes, and we have a tired unhappy boy to navigate through the system.  This time, however, he slept well on both flights (Frankfurt to Singapore and Singapore to Melbourne), and we managed to get back home with very little jetlag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a good time was had by all.  It&amp;rsquo;s good to be back, even if we have to struggle through a bit more of winter here.  At least &lt;a href=&#34;http://lions.com.au&#34;&gt;our AFL team&lt;/a&gt; is performing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-pile-on-the-pressure-in-finals-bid/2007/08/04/1185648222098.html&#34;&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/lions-in-flagcontender-form-matthews/2007/07/30/1185647829342.html&#34;&gt;than&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/rfmatchreport/pies-have-no-answers-against-roaring-lions/2007/07/28/1185339332180.html&#34;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;, so we might be able to cope with the end of the season here in football-mad Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived in a sunny and summery Prague.  The locals tell me they it&amp;rsquo;s cooler than the unseasonably warm that it&amp;rsquo;s been in the last few years, but it seems nicely summery for one who has come from a winter.  I&amp;rsquo;m now chatting in the office with &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=801&#34;&gt;Timothy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jarda.peregrin.cz/welcome.htm&#34;&gt;Jarda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=798&#34;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/a&gt;, and monopolising Jarda&amp;rsquo;s computer while the others do work preparing for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/06/17/heading_off/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m waiting in Gate 9 at the international terminal &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melbourne-airport.com.au/&#34;&gt;Melbourne Airport&lt;/a&gt;, getting ready to board my first flight on my trip to Europe.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a short hop &amp;ndash; Singapore/Frankfurt/Prague, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll be in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mcdo.cz/&#34;&gt;very nice place&lt;/a&gt; for what to all appearances will be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://logika.flu.cas.cz/redaction.php?action=showRedaction&amp;amp;id_categoryNode=852&#34;&gt;very enjoyable conference&lt;/a&gt;.  From then, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illc.uva.nl/GPMR-LS1/&#34;&gt;Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, and then Denmark (K&amp;oslash;benhavn, and &amp;Aring;rhus) to meet up with Christine and Zachary, to have a little &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.legoland.dk&#34;&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt; while Christine does some work.  On the way out, it&amp;rsquo;s Wroc&amp;#322;aw, where I&amp;rsquo;ll play a little part in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~pkowa/lc2007.html&#34;&gt;big conference&lt;/a&gt; before heading home with Zachary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, let me know if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be around anywhere in the vicinity during this European trip.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be catching up with some mates, but it&amp;rsquo;s always fun to meet more friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I owe you an email, that&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve been ridiculously busy preparing for this trip, teaching courses, looking after the boy, etc&amp;hellip; But I&amp;rsquo;m ploughing through my backlog, and I might &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; get there in the next few weeks.  One can hope!)&lt;/p&gt;

What we mistakenly called &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; are actually &lt;em&gt;finials&lt;/em&gt;. (I&amp;rsquo;ve corrected the caption on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/phonecam/Dragon%20finial,%20Brunswick%20West,%20shot%20taken%20April%2011,%202007.jpg&#34;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; in case you don&amp;rsquo;t understand what Christine meant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine took that photo on a finial-photographing expedition with Zachary and a friend from his class in school, on Zachary&amp;rsquo;s birthday a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2002/05/14/job_at_auckland/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, logic jobs in Philosophy Departments are pretty rare.  Well, as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/04/logic-job-at-auckland-nz.html&#34;&gt;Richard mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s a logic job in Philosophy at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/departments/index.cfm?S=D_PHIL&#34;&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;.  A little bird has told me that even though the deadline is close (May 18), they&amp;rsquo;re keen to get the word out to get as many applicants as possible.  So, if you qualify (PhD or equivalent in philosophy, teaching experience, some research publications) then hop to it and apply.  The details are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vacancies.auckland.ac.nz/positiondetail.asp?p=5057&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;p&gt;Liveblogging talks was a bit beyond me, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping up with a few notes on the talks &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;here in Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  They&amp;rsquo;re not as extensive as my notes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/#commentbox&#34;&gt;Branden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_delia_graff_fara&#34;&gt;Delia&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s talks, but they&amp;rsquo;ll give you an idea of the fun we&amp;rsquo;ve been having here.  (After lunch today, there&amp;rsquo;s a batch of five talks, including mine.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write up comments on those, since before dinner I have to catch a shuttle to Calgary to catch a plane early tomorrow morning.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the jump, comments on the talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- BREAK --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-afternoon:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Monday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.uconn.edu/department/beall/beall.html&#34;&gt;JC Beall&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/glanzberg/home.htm&#34;&gt;Michael Glanzberg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;Truth and Paradox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this was a very nice talk, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there!  I misread the program, and thought it was at 3pm and not 2pm.  So, I missed out on it.  At least it gave JC a chance to make some jokes at my expense&amp;hellip;  I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/beall-glanzberg.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to catch up, since I am &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; truth and paradoxes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://members.cox.net/wehmeier/&#34;&gt;Kai Wehmeier&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Identity is not a relation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai&amp;rsquo;s elegant talk was on Wittgensteinian predicate logic: logic in which distinct variables must denote distinct objects, and in which we do not have an identity predicate.  It seems well suited to introductory logic classes &amp;ndash; or at least, better suited to some untutored judgements about how to say things &amp;ndash; since to say &amp;ldquo;there are two &lt;em&gt;F*s&amp;rdquo; you simply say (&amp;#8707;*x&lt;/em&gt;)(&amp;#8707;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;)(&lt;em&gt;Fx&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Fy&lt;/em&gt;), and we don&amp;rsquo;t require the usual (&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8800; &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) conjunct.  Kai looked at how one might extend this logic to include names.  This is a tricky thing to get right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting material.  There are a number of different reasons one might want Wittgensteinian predicate logic: the metaphysical reason (identity just &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; a relation, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;relate&lt;/em&gt;), and the linguistic data.  Kai thinks the metaphysical reason is the most interesting one.  That&amp;rsquo;s probably right.   I &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; parallels with linguistic data will draw you further away from Wittgensteinian logic since it stays quite close to the syntax of classical predicate logic.  I think that the linguistic data is better modelled by including even more &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; features in the formal language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/&#34;&gt;Yiannis Moschovakis&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Synonymy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yiannis gave a clear talk looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ynm/papers/lcmsfinal.pdf&#34;&gt;his development&lt;/a&gt; of the &amp;#955;-calculus with recursion clauses as model or account of &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt;, giving an account of synonymy.  The calculus is very elegant: it treats a &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; as an &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt; for determining a reference (an idea that is common in everyday explanations of the relationship between sense and reference).  One sweet feature of the calculus is that it can distinguish between synonymy or non-synonymy of different paradoxical senses, which have no reference.  The liar algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;~p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;) differs as an algorithm from the truth-teller algorithm (to check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this, check &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, to check this&amp;hellip;), even though neither have a reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca/people/~byi&#34;&gt;Byeong-Uk Yi&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Is Logic axiomatisable?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byeong-Uk talked about compactness and the logic of plurals.  There were lots of examples of arguments that show that if we take plural constructions to be within the scope of logic (and surely, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be?), then we&amp;rsquo;ll have failures of compactness.  (Some arguments with infinitely many premies are not valid if we use any finite subset of those premises.)  The examples are good, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of them.   I think it will help if we have an idea of what logic is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, or other ways to demarcate the logical from the non-logical, to see the pros-and-cons of choices concerning compactness and non-compactness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;monday-evening:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Monday evening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we had four wonderful short (15 minute!) talks by graduate students: Kate Manne (formerly of Melbourne, now at MIT), on supervaluations; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/&#34;&gt;Kenny Easwaran&lt;/a&gt; (Berkeley) on probability and dominance reasoning; Eleni Kalyvianaki (Athens) developing Yainnis&amp;rsquo; calculus for meaning, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/~rurbania/&#34;&gt;Rafal Urbaniak&lt;/a&gt; (Calgary) on Lesniewski&amp;rsquo;s calculus.  All four were slick, elegant and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-morning:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Tuesday morning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/logblog/2007/02/modality-morning.html&#34;&gt;Modality Morning&lt;/a&gt;.  First up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kracht.humnet.ucla.edu/marcus/index.html&#34;&gt;Marcus Kracht&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The certain past and possible future of modal logic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a survey talk: the first part, on propositional modal logic, and the second part, on modal &lt;em&gt;predicate&lt;/em&gt; logic.  Modal predicate logic is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of philosophical questions.  In the survey, Marcus looked at different options for giving semantics for modal predicate logic. Marcus mentioned the work of Shehtman &amp;amp; Skvortsov  on modal &amp;ldquo;metaframes&amp;rdquo;.  This was new to me.  These metaframes treat don&amp;rsquo;t contain a domain of &amp;lsquo;objects&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the quantifier is treated as another kind of context shift &amp;ndash; between different horizontal &amp;lsquo;slices&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; the individual frames. This was interesting.    &lt;a href=&#34;http://kleene.ss.uci.edu/~aldo/&#34;&gt;Aldo&lt;/a&gt; and I had the same thought: another connection between quantifiers and modalities is that quantifiers themselves are &lt;em&gt;families&lt;/em&gt; of modal operators &amp;ndash; one for each variable.  In a frame semantics we should have points of evaluation, and the quantifiers and modalities each shift us around in the frame.  Different conditions give us different interactions between quantifiers and modalities.  It&amp;rsquo;d be nice to get a very general picture of how this works, and when the different accessibility conditions &amp;lsquo;factor out&amp;rsquo; into a domain of worlds and a domain of objects.  For more of Marcus&amp;rsquo;s line on this material, see his paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/counterparts.pdf&#34;&gt;Logically Possible Worlds and Counterpart Semantics for Modal Logic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~okutz/&#34;&gt;Oliver Kutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/&#34;&gt;Steve Awodey&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/awodey.pdf&#34;&gt;Topological semantics for first-order modal logic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (joint with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pitt.edu/~kok6/&#34;&gt;Kohei Kishida&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very different talk.  It was not general, but highly specific: Steve presented a very elegant topological (sheaf) semantics for quanitfied S4.  The logic is not complete for the obvious frame semantics.  However, the sheaf semantics is completely natural and completely elegant.  There are &amp;ldquo;worlds&amp;rdquo; (the points in the space underlying the sheaf) and objects (the elements in the fibres), and the objects can generally vary from &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;world.&amp;rdquo;  The difference with standard frame semantics comes in the interpretation of the modality: in the natural models it is not intrepreted by an accessibility relation, but generally by a topological interior operator (as is well known in the interpretation of propositional S4 in topological spaces).  The heavy duty mathematics comes from the sheaf theory required to prove completeness.  The &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; is elegant.  I have not yet seen the &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosophical work will come in the interpretation of these results. What does it &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  The exciting technical work comes in the extensions.  For what other systems do techniques like these work? I&amp;rsquo;d love to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuesday-afternoon:4d1a7395d8ca68bc0f86d9ac5ca4086e&#34;&gt;Tuesday afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two talks in the afternoon were on &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0114/&#34;&gt;Volker Halbach&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Kripke-Feferman theory of truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volker explained how the internal and external logic of truth differ for the Kripke&amp;ndash;Feferman (KF) theory of truth.  It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; theory, but what it says about &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; is not classical.  We have &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; ~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; as a theorem, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8744; T~&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  One way to make them match up is to &lt;em&gt;weaken&lt;/em&gt; the external logic to be &lt;em&gt;partial&lt;/em&gt;.  Volker showed that doing this would weaken the theory considerably.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a part of the paper, but this is an argument for his favoured theory of truth Friedman&amp;ndash;Sheard (FS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://homepages.ed.ac.uk/jketland/&#34;&gt;Jeff Ketland&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Truth and Reflection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was on the structure of &lt;em&gt;deflationism&lt;/em&gt;, the view that truth is a purely formal notion and not a substantial one. (Whatever that means &amp;ndash; Jeff noted that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to make these much more than slogans.)  One way to make this clearer is to focus on some precise issues.  Should adding a truth predicate be &lt;em&gt;conservative&lt;/em&gt; over a theory without the truth predicate (should it leave the ground-level theory &lt;em&gt;untouched&lt;/em&gt; meaning that you can&amp;rsquo;t prove anything new about the basic theory)?  Should it give you &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;?  That is, the addition of truth to a theory &lt;em&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; enable you to prove, relative to that theory, that every claim of that theory is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;?  This seems plausible &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a generalisation of the claim that if &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (in the old theory) then T&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.  Jeff rehearsed the argument why you can&amp;rsquo;t have both conservativity and reflection in general.  Why not?  Take a theory of arithmetic.  If we have reflection, then we can prove that the original theory is consistent (at least if the truth predicate behaves sensibly).  He went on to explain why you want &lt;em&gt;reflection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I think about this.  Reflection &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; reasonable, given that we don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt; favourite (axiomatisable, consistent) theory of arithmetic &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re all incomplete &amp;ndash; would it be so bad to have a series of theories of arithmetic, of increasing strength, such that when we add a truth predicate to one of the theories in the series, you get another theory in the series.  Is this enough conservativity, and enough reflection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bris.ac.uk/philosophy/department/staff/hl.html&#34;&gt;Hannes Leitgeb&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;Applications of mathematics to philosophy: four case studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hannes Leitgeb has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7813l8j5g324766/&#34;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/j85373r152218p0m/&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2731731994655g3/&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg628jx481l41785/&#34;&gt;tr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.ndjfl/1012429715&#34;&gt;uth&lt;/a&gt;.  But he didn&amp;rsquo;t give talk about truth this time.  Instead we had very-elegant explanations of four (no, five! &amp;ndash; we had a free extra) different ways mathematics can be applied to philosophical problems. It was a great example of Hannes&amp;rsquo;s work.   As Alasdair Urquhart said in conversation, it was very &lt;em&gt;Carnapian&lt;/em&gt; in its optimism for how creative formal theorising can clarify philosophical issues.  It was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; neat.  Go read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucalgary.ca/~rzach/static/banff/leitgeb.pdf&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; to get some idea of the many intresting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet more to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finished up the slides for my talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, the slides are available here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/papers/bradwardine-banff-talk.pdf&#34;&gt;Modal Models for Bradwardine&amp;rsquo;s Truth&lt;/a&gt; [1.3MB pdf]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a talk giving a modal logic interpretation for a medieval theory of truth due to Thomas Bradwardine, as it&amp;rsquo;s reconstructed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/read.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Read&lt;/a&gt;.  This will hopefully help out Steve&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~slr/medieval.html&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, by providing tools for exploring the strength of this kind of theory of truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write up an extended paper version of this after getting comments from the audience.  Since the audience contains people who know a heck of a lot more than me about truth and about modal logic, I&amp;rsquo;m a little more on the anxious side than usual for such things.  Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The next &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff talk&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.princeton.edu/~graff/&#34;&gt;Delia Graff Fara&lt;/a&gt;, on &amp;ldquo;Relative identity and de re modality.&amp;rdquo;  She&amp;rsquo;s defending the thesis that material objects are identical to the matter of which they&amp;rsquo;re constituted.  For example, the statue Goliath (&lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;) is identical to the lump of clay Lumpel (&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;).  She wants to allow that &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while having &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt; differing in their temporal and modal properties.  So, for example, in the future, a some more clay might become a part of the statue &lt;em&gt;G&lt;/em&gt;, while not becoming a part of the lump of clay &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;. The original lump of clay is still present (and is joined by more clay), the original statue is still present, and is now &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt;.  You can see why this is desirable: after the addition of more clay, there&amp;rsquo;s still only one statue there, and the old statue did not disappear only to be replaced by a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delia wants to preserve the truth of claims that statues don&amp;rsquo;t have all their parts essentially, while portions of matter do have their parts essentially, while holding that statues are identical to portions of matter.  How can we do this?  I find this kind of work interesting, but deeply difficult.  Delia&amp;rsquo;s talk had a fair bit of relatively informal philosophy in it &amp;ndash; it was a discussion of counterpart relations and such critters &amp;ndash; and other participants followed the dialectic more closely than I did.  I always get confused by this kind of problem.  There are other talks at the workshop on quantified modal logic, which will hopefully give me some helpful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Banff: Branden Fitelson on Formal Epistemology</title>
      <link>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2007 03:22:30 AEDT</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://consequently.github.io/news/2007/02/20/in_banff_branden_fitelson_on_formal_epistemology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;The first talk in &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2007/02/20/in_banff/&#34;&gt;Banff&lt;/a&gt; is by &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org&#34;&gt;Branden Fitelson&lt;/a&gt;, who is giving a &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Survey&amp;rdquo; of Formal Epistemology: some propaganda, and an example&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/search?q=formal+epistemology&#34;&gt;general movement&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=&#34;http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/R/Wayne.D.Riggs-1/epistemology/index.html&#34;&gt;carving out&lt;/a&gt; the discipline of &amp;lsquo;formal epistemology&amp;rsquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a partly political talk, recounting the motivation for Formal Epistemology.  He recounted Bob Meyer&amp;rsquo;s manifesto of the &amp;ldquo;Logicians Liberation League.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s worth recounting the section Branden quoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be deceived, Establishment pigs (this means you too, Establishment dogs). The subservience of past generations of logicians does not mean that we shall bear forever our treatment as animals (you barnyard fowl). We are human beings (you swine). You are living in a day when logicians will not any longer endure your taunts, your slurs, your insults (you filthy vermin). In the name of A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell we gather; in the spirit of R. Carnap and A. Tarski, we march; by the word of W. V. O. Quine, we shall prevail. Beware you snakes of the Philosophical Power Structure, which you have created and which you maintain to put down the logician; you have caged the eagle of reason, the dove of wisdom, and the lark of a definite, precisely formulated formal system, with exact formation rules, a recursive set of axioms, and clear and cogent rules of inference, and you have made them your pigeons. Oh, you filterable viruses, we will shake you off and fly once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifesto was presented in 1969, but according to Branden it has relevance today: Branden sees &amp;ldquo;Formal Epistemology&amp;rdquo; as the application of formal techniques to broadly epistemological philosophical questions &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty broad.  Branden sees it as formal techniques applied to all areas of philosophy other than metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the talk cashed out a parallel between a &amp;ldquo;relevantist&amp;rdquo; argument against classical deductive logic and the Goodman &amp;ldquo;grue&amp;rdquo; argument against Carnapian inductive logic.  Branded argued that the friend of Carnapian inductive logic can make the same kind of response to the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of confirmation&amp;rdquo; that the friend of classical logic can against the &amp;ldquo;paradoxes of entailment&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; to distinguish entailment/consequence and the constraints on rational inference.  What do you need to do in the case of inductive logic?  It turns on the &lt;em&gt;Requirement of Total Evidence&lt;/em&gt;: that evidential support is always defined only in terms of the total evidence available to the agent in the situation. (I won&amp;rsquo;t rehearse the entire argument here: check &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitelson.org/banff_handout.pdf&#34;&gt;Branden&amp;rsquo;s slides&lt;/a&gt; for the details.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks right to me.  The interesting issue one has when one rejects a bridge principle like this (between entailment and rational infererence, or between evidential support and the totality of evidence available) is to give an alternative explanation of the tie between the two things thought to be connected by the bridge.  People thought the bridge principle was plausible for a reason.  Those of us (Gilbert Harman in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Change-View-Principles-Gilbert-Harman/dp/0262081555/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Change in View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and JC and me in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Pluralism-J-C-Beall/dp/0199288410/consequentlyorg&#34;&gt;Logical Pluralism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) have to say something about the connection between deductive consequence and rational inference.  Similarly, Branden (and any defender of an inductive logic) should say something about what bridge principles are plausible and not suspect to these paradoxes.  Branden will be trying out some of these principles in his forthcoming book on inductive logic.&lt;/p&gt;

The program is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pims.math.ca/birs/workshops/2007/07w5060/Programme07w5060.pdf&#34;&gt;very full&lt;/a&gt;, and I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to report on &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; going on here.  (Heck, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even reported back from our time in India, despite &lt;a href=&#34;http://consequently.org/news/2006/12/19/off_to_india/&#34;&gt;popular demand&lt;/a&gt;.)  So, please let me give my apologies in advance if youre talk doesn&amp;rsquo;t get reported here.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I was so interested in it I had to &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; and not blog.&lt;/p&gt;
