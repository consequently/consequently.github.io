<p>My last post to <a href="http://consequently.org">consequently.org</a> was in late in 2010, well over four years ago. You&rsquo;d be <em>justified</em> in thinking that I&rsquo;d abandoned the site&mdash;but you&rsquo;d also be <em>wrong</em>. I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with the site behind the scenes. The software I&rsquo;d been using to maintain the site has long since <a href="https://github.com/TwP/webby">fallen into disrepair</a>, so updating the site meant porting everything to another content management system. At least, it would have to mean that, given that I <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> really keen to burn the whole thing to the ground and start again from scratch. This required <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t require <em>four years</em>, but it did require an uninterrupted stretch of time to tinker with software, experiment with the design, and finally, piece everything back together.</p>

<p>Before getting back into all of this website business, however, I wanted to answer one question. Is the investment of time worth it? <em>What&rsquo;s the point of a personal website these days, anyway</em>?</p>

<p>After all, people can <a href="http://twitter.com/consequently">find me on twitter</a>, where you might find a brief remark or more each week. (Or you might find <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23advent%20OR%20%23adventure%20OR%20%23christmas%20from%3Aconsequently%20since%3A2014-11-30%20until%3A2014-12-27&amp;src=typd">virtual “advent calendar”</a> when I&rsquo;m a bit more adventurous.) I occasionally <a href="http://instagram.com/consequently">post photos on Instagram</a>, so you can see me there if you like that sort of thing. You can find (most of) <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfBBS7AAAAAJ">my publications on Google Scholar</a>, and you can even find <a href="http://vimeo.com/consequently/">instructional videos I&rsquo;ve made available to the public on Vimeo</a>. You can even join in with <a href="http://coursera.org/course/logic1">classes I</a> <a href="http://coursera.org/course/logic2">teach (with Jen Davoren) on Coursera</a>, and you can use <a href="http://philevents.org">philevents.org</a> to <a href="http://philevents.org/search/index/searchForm?span=PAST&amp;customTag=&amp;speakers%5B0%5D.id=1176&amp;autonamespeaker=Greg+Restall&amp;series=&amp;search=true&amp;hits=&amp;widget=&amp;Search=Search">keep track of talks I&rsquo;ve given</a>. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve  been inactive on the web, even though I haven&rsquo;t been leaving a much of a trace <em>here</em> lately. Isn&rsquo;t all that web presence enough?</p>

<p>I think it isn&rsquo;t. At least, it isn&rsquo;t enough for me in 2015. Let me explain why, by turning to the different sections of this site.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://consequently.org/writing">Publications</a></strong>: The <a href="http://consequently.org/writing">writing</a> section keeps track of all of my academic publications. Where I can, I archive pre- or post-publication versions of my papers, and sometimes I upload versions of papers here <em>before</em> submission, to get the ideas out as quickly as possible, and to get feedback. I could do that without having my own website. (<a href="http://philpapers.org">Philpapers.org</a> is a great way for people to upload draft papers in philosophy, for example.) But at your <em>own</em> site, you can present yourself however you see fit, and you can make it easy for people to find your work. You provide a <em>source</em> for  aggregators to aggregate. That&rsquo;s one reason to take control of your own body of work. As long as the HTTP protocol keeps going, I can host my own work and people can find it. <em>Google Scholar</em>, <em>philpapers</em>, or <em>journal websites</em> can come or go. As long as people can get here, they can keep track of my work. If someone asks how to keep up with what I write, <em><a href="http://consequently.org/writing">this</a></em> where I&rsquo;ll point them. A <code>url</code> I control: <a href="http://consequently.org/writing">http://consequently.org/writing</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://consequently.org/class">Classes</a></strong>: The <em>other</em> sections of the website were more pressing for me, though, as I thought about why it was important to have a <a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/"><em>room of one&rsquo;s own</em></a> on the web. I&rsquo;ve been making more of my <em>teaching</em> resources available to the public, through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/gregrestall">Coursera</a> and using <a href="http://vimeo.com/consequently/">Vimeo</a>. While I use our campus <a href="https://lms.unimelb.edu.au">LMS</a> to distribute materials to my on-campus students, that&rsquo;s basically walled off to non-students. I can&rsquo;t point non-Melbourne students to that if I want to give them access to teaching resources, or simply to catch up on what I&rsquo;ve been teaching. I&rsquo;d like to have somewhere to do that. So, <a href="http://consequently.org/class">http://consequently.org/class</a> will serve as a directory of all my recent and future teaching resources—at least, all of the resources I&rsquo;ll be making freely available to everyone, and it can be a straightforward first port-of-call for anyone who wants to check out a class I teach, to see if it interests them. Teaching is a very important part of what I do, and I&rsquo;m happy to spread this material far and wide if it will help others. I think it will help me, too: the more opportunities for feedback on teaching materials I get, the better.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://consequently.org/presentation">Presentations</a></strong>: The same holds for <em>talks</em> I give. I&rsquo;d like there to be a simple, stable URL for each talk, whether it&rsquo;s <a href="http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/towards-fixed-point-models-logicmelb/">a</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/trmra-asubl5/">research</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/cemd-anu/">talk</a>, or a <a href="http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/christian-academic-monash/">different</a> <a href="http://consequently.org/presentation/2014/tractatus-masterclass/">kind of presentation</a>. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll be able to put materials from talks online, and sometimes I won&rsquo;t. But in any case, I want to have an archive of recent and upcoming talks.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://consequently.org/news">News</a></strong>: Of course, there&rsquo;s also the <em>news</em> or <em>blog</em> section of the website, which can be the home for not-academic pieces of writing which don&rsquo;t fit well into <a href="http://twitter.com/consequently">140 character</a> chunks, and which don&rsquo;t find a place in <a href="http://consequently.org/writing">more considered pieces</a>&hellip; These are pieces of writing like <em>this very discussion</em>. While some find places like <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> a suitable home for longer-than-twitter online writing, I&rsquo;m fond of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/catarinadutilhnovaes/">people&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.umsu.de/wo/">own</a> <a href="http://kjhealy.org">websites</a>, and I&rsquo;m itching to get back into it, with some occasional writing of my own, to supplement more considered academic pieces.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s the <em>why</em> of my return to this site.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s end with the <em>how</em>. The short answer is what you see in the footer of the website (as I write this). <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is the CMS that wires things together into the website. It&rsquo;s fast, relatively straightforward to learn if you&rsquo;re used to command-line tools, and can it cope with the not-completely-straightforward taxonomy of my site. Hugo seems to be under active development by its founder <a href="https://twitter.com/spf13/">Steve Francia</a> together with an active <a href="http://discuss.gohugo.io">community</a> of users and developers. It looks like it&rsquo;ll be around for a while.</p>

<p>I hand-coded the HTML (designing it to be <em>relatively</em> friendly for small-screen devices) using the <a href="http://imperavi.com/kube/">Kube Web Framework</a> from <a href="http://imperavi.com">Imperavi</a>. (Please let me know if you see any website design bugs.) The main body and header font is <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya">Alegreya</a>, a gorgeous font designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/juandelperal">Juan Pablo del Peral</a> for the Argentinian Type Foundry <a href="http://www.huertatipografica.com">Huerta Tipogr&aacute;fica</a>. It&rsquo;s hosted on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya">Google Fonts</a>. Apply liberal doses of <a href="http://marketlane.com.au">caffeine</a> and <a href="http://cockburnproject.net">Bruce Cockburn</a>, a few late nights&rsquo; worth of coding, and you get the website you have before you. I hope you like it. Please get back to me, by <a href="http://twitter.com/consequently">replying to @consequently</a> on Twitter, or by email, if you have any feedback.</p>
